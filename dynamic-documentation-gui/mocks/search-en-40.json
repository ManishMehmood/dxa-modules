It is the most numerous of the Spheniscus penguins. Its nearest\n               relatives are \n               African penguin (Spheniscus demersus), \n               Humboldt penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) and \n               Galapagos penguin (Spheniscus mendiculus). They are native to the Strait of Magellan in the cool climate of southern Chile, hence the name's origin. \n               \n            \n            \n            \n             \n               \n            \n            \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n         \n         \n            \n            Parent topic: Spheniscus (Banded penguins)\n            \n         \n         \n      \n       \n         \n          Description\n         \n         \n          \n            \t \n            Magellanic penguins are medium-sized penguins which grow to be 61-76 cm (24-30 in) tall and weigh between 2.7 kg and 6.5 kg\n               (5.9-14.3 lbs). The males are larger than the females, and the weight of both drops while the parents nurture their young.\n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n             \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            Adults have black backs and white abdomens. There are two black bands between the head and the breast, with the lower band\n               shaped in an inverted horseshoe. The head is black with a broad white border that runs from behind the eye, around the black\n               ear-coverts and chin, and joins at the throat. Chicks and younger penguins have grey-blue backs, with a more faded grey-blue\n               colour on their chest. Magellanic penguins can live up to 25 years in the wild, but as much as 30 years in captivity. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            Young birds usually have a blotched pattern on their feet, which fades as they age.

To help the fight against the oil spills, zoo representatives from all over\n                  the world come and adopt the hatchlings, and breed them there. The decline of fish populations is also responsible, as well\n                  as predators such as sea lions and giant petrels, which prey on the chicks \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               Climate change has displaced fish populations, so Magellanic penguins must swim an extra 25 miles (40 km) further from the\n                  nest for fish. While the penguins are swimming an extra 50 miles (80.4 km), their mates are sitting on a nest and starving.\n                  A colony being tracked by University of Washington professor P. Dee Boersma, about 1,000 miles (1,609 km) south of Buenos\n                  Aires, has fallen by more than 20 percent in the past 22 years, leaving 200,000 breeding pairs. Some younger penguins are\n                  now moving their breeding colonies north to be closer to fish, but, in some cases, this is putting them on private, unprotected\n                  lands. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               At present, 12 of 17 penguin species are experiencing rapid population declines. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n       \n         \n         Behaviour\n         \n         \n          \n            \t \n            \n               Diet \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               Magellanic penguins feed in the water, preying on cuttlefish, sardines, squid, krill, and other crustaceans, and ingest sea\n                  water with their prey.

The chicks are cared for by both parents for 29 days and are fed every two to three days.

Most Antarctic\n                  penguin species nest in large high density aggregations of birds. In contrast yellow-eyed penguins do not nest within visual\n                  sight of each other. While they can be seen coming ashore in groups of 4-6 or more individuals then disperse along track to\n                  individual nests sites out of sight of each other. The consensus view of New Zealand penguin workers is that it is preferable\n                  to use habitat rather than colony to refer to areas where yellow-eyed penguins nest.Nest sites are selected in August and\n                  normally two eggs are laid in September. The incubation duties (lasting 39-51 days) are shared by both parents who may spend\n                  several days on the nest at a time. For the first six weeks after hatching, the chicks are guarded during the day by one parent\n                  while the other is at sea feeding. The foraging adult returns at least daily to feed the chicks and relieve the partner. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               After the chicks are six weeks of age, both parents go to sea to supply food to their rapidly growing offspring. Chicks usually\n                  fledge in mid February and are totally independent from then on. Chick fledge weights are generally between 5 and 6 kg. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               First breeding occurs at 3-4 years of age and long term partnerships are formed. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            \n               Predators \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               In the water they are killed by sharks and sea lions.

Mustelids (ferrets, weasels, ...) and rats will\n                  rob eggs and small chicks from the nest. Destruction (clearing) of the forests on the coast and grazing cattle have a very\n                  negative influence on their population number too.

During incubation (32 till 34 days), the parents alternate with equally long\n                  shifts of 10 days. The males guard and take care for the hatched chick during the first period of 24-26 days, while the female\n                  forages and feeds the chick daily. Then the chicks form small creches and the parents both feed the chick. The chicks moult\n                  to their juvenile plumage and fledge in February (December-January at the northern subspecies) when they are 65 till 75 days\n                  old. The adults moult in April, after a period at sea to eat. For the northern subspecies, this period at sea before moulting\n                  lasts a lot longer (till up to 2 months) than for the southern one. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n   ",

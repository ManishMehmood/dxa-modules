Comparable to Spheniscus species, they breed in holes (burrows) as a defence against the sun and predators. \n               \n            </p>\n            \n            \n            <div class=\"p\">The group has a unique rhythm while they are nocturnal on land. They take a plunge early in the morning at sunrise and return\n               not before sunset to feed and care for their chicks.

They dig in flowerbeds,\n               or make their burrow under (especially wooden) houses. During courtship, they keep awake the inhabitants (nocturnal on land)\n               by their calls and fights. And while feeding their chicks, some fish remains will cause a foul smell. Also sick or dead birds\n               under a house can give off a stench and inconvenience. \n               \n            </p>\n            \n            \n            <p class=\"p\">The group belongs to the warm sea penguins, which means they live in moderate oceans. \n               \n            </p>\n            \n         </div>\n         \n      </div>\n      \n      <div class=\"related-links\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n         \n         <ul class=\"ullinks\">\n            \n            <li class=\"link ulchildlink\"><strong><a href=\"/1184146/517162/penguin-publication/brush-tailed-penguins-(pygoscelis)\">Little penguin (Eudyptula minor)</a></strong><br />\n               \n            </li>\n            \n         </ul>\n         \n         \n         <div class=\"familylinks\">\n            \n            <div class=\"parentlink\"><strong>Parent topic:</strong> <a class=\"link\" href=\"/1184146/516000/penguin-publication/brush-tailed-penguins-(pygoscelis)\">Types of penguins</a></div>\n            \n         </div>\n         \n      </div>\n   "

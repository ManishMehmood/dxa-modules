Gallinules occur in temperate, tropical, and subtropical regions worldwide and are about the size of bantam hens but with\n            a compressed body like the related rails and coots. They are about 30 to 45 cm (12 to 18 inches) long, with long, thin toes\n            that enable them to run over floating vegetation and with a prominent frontal shield (a fleshy plate on the forehead). Many\n            species have brightly coloured areas of plumage or skin. \n            \t \n         </p>\n         \n         \t \n         <div class=\"p\"> \n            \t\t\n            <div class=\"fig fignone\" id=\"FIG_BAA585437D0449B481E2F3C039021240\">\n               <img class=\"image\" id=\"IMAGE_0CF660B1084442A6BA21C965DA31E218\" src=\"/gui/mocks/bin/1184146-515586-16.jpg\" /> \n               \t\t\n            </div>\n            \n            \t \n         </div>\n         \n         \t \n         <p class=\"p\">Gallinules are noisy and inquisitive birds, less furtive in their actions than most rails.

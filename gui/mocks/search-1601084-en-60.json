Although herons resemble birds in some other families, such as the \n            \t\tStorks, \n            \t\tIbis, \n            \t\tSpoonbills and \n            \t\tCranes, they differ from these in flying with their necks retracted, not outstretched. They are also one of the bird groups that\n            have powder down. Some members of this group nest colonially in trees. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n          \n            \t\t\n             \n               \t\t   \n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         The herons are medium to large sized birds with long legs and necks. They exhibit very little sexual dimorphism in size. The\n            necks are able to kink in an S-shape, due to the modified shape of the sixth vertebrae. The neck is able to retract and extend,\n            and is retracted during flight, unlike most other long-necked birds. The legs are long and strong and in almost every species\n            are unfeathered from the lower part of the tibia. In flight the legs and feet are held backward. The feet of herons have long\n            thin toes, with three forward pointing ones and one going backward. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n          \n            \t\t\n             \n               \t\t   \n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         The bill is generally long and harpoon like. It can vary from extremely fine, as in the agami heron, to thick as in the grey\n            heron. The most atypical bill is owned by the boat-billed heron, which has a broad thick bill. The bill, as well as other\n            bare parts of the body, is usually yellow, black or brown coloured, although this colour can vary during the breeding season.\n            The wings are broad and long, exhibiting 10-11 primaries feathers (the boat-billed heron has only nine), 15-20 secondaries\n            and 12 rectrices (10 in the bitterns). The feathers of the herons are soft and the plumage is usually blue, black, brown,\n            grey or white, and can often be strikingly complex. Amongst the day herons there is little sexual dimorphism in plumage (except\n            in the pond-herons); differences between the sexes are the rule for the night herons and smaller bitterns. Many species also\n            have different colour morphs. In the Pacific reef heron there are both dark and light colour morphs, and the percentage of\n            each morph varies geographically. White morphs only occur in areas with coral beaches \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         For more information: \n            \t\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n         \n         \n            \n            Parent topic: Other birds\n            \n         \n         \n      \n   ",

Coots are found throughout the world in larger inland waters\n            and streams, where they swim and bob for food, mostly plants, seeds, mollusks, and worms. Coots have greenish or bluish gray\n            feet, the toes of which are fringed by a lobed membrane that facilitates swimming and walking over plant-choked marshes and\n            ooze.

About 45 centimetres (18 inches) long and sometimes more than 900 grams (2 pounds) in weight,\n            the seemingly short-winged coot appears to rise with difficulty from the water, pattering along the surface with its feet.\n            It is capable of long-sustained and rapid flight.

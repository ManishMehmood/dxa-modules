Its nearest\n               relatives are the African Penguin, the Magellanic Penguin and the Gal√°pagos Penguin. The penguin is named after the cold water\n               current it swims in, which is itself named after Alexander von Humboldt, an explorer. \n               \n            </p>\n            \n            \n            <p class=\"p\">Humboldt penguins are medium-sized penguins, growing to 56-70 cm (22-28 in) long and a weight of 3.6-5.9 kg (8-13 lbs).

They have blackish-grey upperparts and whitish underparts, with a black breast-band that extends down the flanks to\n               the thigh. They have a fleshy-pink base to the bill.

They have two layers of feathers; a down layer for insulation and a top\n                  layer that is flat and waterproof that prevents water from reaching their body. They regularly preen their feathers to keep\n                  them in good condition. They moult between July and September and this takes approximately 10 days. Like most penguins, Humboldt\n                  penguins are able to drink salt water due to their supraorbital gland which filters excess salt from their bloodstream by\n                  way of a capillary just above the penguins eyes. The excess salt is then expelled through the penguin's nose in a salty brine.\n                  Humboldt penguins are agile swimmers and they can reach speeds up to 32 km/hr (20 mph). They have excellent eyesight both\n                  underwater and on land. \n                  \t \n               </p>\n               \n               \t \n               <div class=\"fig fignone\" id=\"TOPIC_069F4993436D490089D6254A513D7BEA__FIG_EC7097BFCDBE477AA7D0AF391F522019\"><img class=\"image\" id=\"TOPIC_069F4993436D490089D6254A513D7BEA__IMAGE_47F98093C1A44BDC9C74D6E167F2B2BF\" height=\"525\" width=\"350\" src=\"/app/gui/mocks/bin/1601084-515038-16.jpg\" /> \n                  \t \n               </div>\n               \n            </div> \n            \t \n            <div class=\"section\" id=\"TOPIC_069F4993436D490089D6254A513D7BEA__SECTION_5BFDA74429DA481A9F85820B83530792\">\n               <h3 class=\"title sectiontitle\"> Identification</h3> \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               <p class=\"p\">Similar to Magellanic Penguins, but lacks the second dark breast band and has a wider white band around the head.

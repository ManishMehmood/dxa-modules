They have a black stripe\n               and black spots on the chest, the pattern of spots being unique for every penguin, like human fingerprints. They have pink\n               glands above their eyes, which are used for thermoregulation. The hotter the penguin gets, the more blood is sent to these\n               glands so it may be cooled by the surrounding air, thus making the glands more pink. \n               \t \n            </p>\n            \n            \t \n            <p class=\"p\">This species exhibits slight sexual dimorphism: the males are larger than the females and have larger beaks. \n               \t \n            </p>\n            \n            \t \n            <p class=\"p\"> The beak is more pointed than that of the Humboldt.

African penguins have a very recognizable appearance with a thick\n               band of black that is in the shape of an upside-down horseshoe. They have unique black spots that vary in size and shape per\n               penguin. Magellanic Penguins share a similar characteristic that often confuses the two, the similarity is a double bar on\n               the throat and chest. The penguins have the nickname, the \"Jackass penguin\", they got their nickname from the loud noises\n               they make. They stand about 27 inches (60 cm tall) and weigh from 7 to 11 lbs.

A penguin may consume up to 540 grams of prey every day, but this may increase to over\n                  1 kg when raising older chicks. \n                  \t\t\n               </p>\n               \n               \t\t\n               <p class=\"p\">Due to the collapse of a commercial pilchard fishery in 1960, the African penguin has resorted to eating anchovies. Although\n                  it keeps the penguins alive, it is not their ideal meal due to the low concentration of fat and protein. Their diet changes\n                  throughout the year and it is believed that their aspect of breeding help the penguins maintain their population size. Upon\n                  having hatchlings, although the parent penguins are protective of their hatchlings, the parents will not sacrifice their appetite\n                  for their children. If even in a situation where food is scarce, adult parents will let their children starve before they\n                  let themselves starve. \n                  \t\t\n               </p>\n               \n               \t \n            </div>\n            \n            \t \n            <div class=\"section\" id=\"TOPIC_719CF2B0DD374382A74F27628DCE41B8__SECTION_AC16D1145B3B451A988BD21F36E4DE85\">\n               <h3 class=\"title sectiontitle\">Breeding</h3> \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               <p class=\"p\">The African penguin is monogamous. It breeds in colonies, and pairs return to the same site each year. The African penguin\n                  has an extended breeding season, with nesting usually peaking from March to May in South Africa, and November and December\n                  in Namibia. A clutch of two eggs are laid either in burrows dug in guano, or scrapes in the sand under boulders or bushes.\n                  Incubation is undertaken equally by both parents for about 40 days. At least one parent guards the chicks until about 30 days,\n                  whereafter the chick joins a creche with other chicks, and both parents head out to sea to forage each day. \n                  \t\t\n               </p>\n               \n               \t\t\n               <p class=\"p\">Chicks fledge at 60 to 130 days, the timing depending on environmental factors such as quality and availability of food.

Penguins spend most of their lives\n                  at sea until it comes time for them to lay their eggs. Due to the high predation by larger mammals inland, the penguins will\n                  go offshore to an island for protection from mammals and natural challenges. African penguins usually breed during the African\n                  winter when temperatures are less torrid. Although it is winter, the heat on the island is still scorching. The penguins need\n                  to find protection for their eggs. In order to do this; they dig guano holes and incubate the penguins there. Due to humans,\n                  though, the amount of guano on the land has significantly dropped. To compensate, penguins dig holes in the sand. Although\n                  effective, the sand gets hot and fills with water during rain easily. The penguins spend three weeks on land to provide for\n                  their offsprings. The eggs are 3-4 times bigger than hen's eggs. Parents usually feed hatchlings during dusk or dawn. \n                  \t\t\n               </p>\n               \n               \t \n            </div>\n            \n            \n         </div>\n         \n         \n      </div>\n      \n   "

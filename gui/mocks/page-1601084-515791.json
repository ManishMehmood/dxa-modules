A single egg\n               (rarely two) is laid on the soil surface or in a burrow or crevice. The chick is tended by both parents and deserted about\n               a week before it is fully fledged; it completes its development on stored fat. During the non-breeding season, these birds\n               roam the open ocean, feeding on squid and small fish. Most gadfly petrels are dark above and light beneath, with long wings\n               and short, wedge-shaped tails. Because they are quite similar in appearance, the species are difficult to distinguish. \n               \t\t\n            </p>\n            \n            \t\t\n            <p class=\"p\">Some of the better known gadfly petrels are the endangered Bermuda petrel, or \n               \t\t  <a class=\"xref\" href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/88425/cahow\" target=\"_blank\"> cahow</a> (Pterodroma cahow, sometimes considered a race of P. hasitata); the dark-rumped petrel, also called the Hawaiian petrel (P.\n               phaeopygia), another endangered species, now concentrated almost entirely on the island of Maui; the phoenix petrel (P. alba),\n               which breeds on several tropical archipelagos; and the black-capped petrel, or diablotin (P. hasitata), formerly found throughout\n               the West Indies but now known only in Haiti.

There are fifteen species of crane in four genera. Unlike the similar-looking\n            but unrelated herons, cranes fly with necks outstretched, not pulled back. Cranes live on all continents except Antarctica\n            and South America. \n            \t \n         </p>\n         \n         \t \n         <p class=\"p\">They are opportunistic feeders that change their diet according to the season and their own nutrient requirements. They eat\n            a range of items from suitably sized small rodents, fish, amphibians, and insects, to grain, berries, and plants. \n            \t \n         </p>\n         \n         \t \n         <p class=\"p\">Cranes construct platform nests in shallow water, and typically lay two eggs at a time. Both parents help to rear the young,\n            which remain with them until the next breeding season. \n            \t \n         </p>\n         \n         \t \n         <p class=\"p\">Some species and populations of cranes migrate over long distances; others do not migrate at all. Cranes are solitary during\n            the breeding season, occurring in pairs, but during the non-breeding season they are gregarious, forming large flocks where\n            their numbers are sufficient. \n            \t \n         </p>\n         \n         \t \n         <div class=\"p\"> \n            \t\t\n            <div class=\"fig fignone\" id=\"FIG_D6EC71CACAB642619C9617B858473285\">\n               <img class=\"image\" id=\"IMAGE_D5D3E0AE149B452BADF440F8DA3CE8B1\" src=\"/app/gui/mocks/bin/1601084-515593-16.jpg\" /> \n               \t\t\n            </div>\n            \n            \t \n         </div>\n         \n         \n      </div>\n      \n      \n      <div class=\"related-links\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n         \n         <div class=\"familylinks\">\n            \n            <div class=\"parentlink\"><strong>Parent topic:</strong> <a class=\"link\" title=\"This topic groups birds of other orders which are predators of penguins or have another relation with the penguins\" href=\"/1601084/515736/penguin-guide/other-birds\">Other birds</a></div>\n            \n         </div>\n         \n      </div>\n   "

It is slightly\n               larger than the European storm petrel and is essentially dark brown in all plumages, except for the white rump and flanks.\n               The feet jut beyond the square ended tail in flight. The European storm petrel has a very distinct whitish lining to the underwing\n               and a nearly all dark upperwing. Wilson's storm petrel has a diffuse pale band along the upper wing coverts and lacks the\n               distinctive white underwing lining. The webbing between the toes is yellow with black spots in pre-breeding age individuals.\n               \t\t\n            </p>\n            \n            \t\t\n            <p class=\"p\">For more information: \n               \t\t  <a class=\"xref\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson's_storm_petrel\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson's_storm_petrel</a>\n               \t\t\n            </p>\n            \n            \t \n         </div>\n         \n         \n      </div>\n      \n      \n      <div class=\"related-links\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n         \n         <div class=\"familylinks\">\n            \n            <div class=\"parentlink\"><strong>Parent topic:</strong> <a class=\"link\" href=\"/1601084/515791/penguin-publication/petrels\">Petrels</a></div>\n            \n         </div>\n         \n      </div>\n   "

To help the fight against the oil spills, zoo representatives from all over\n                  the world come and adopt the hatchlings, and breed them there. The decline of fish populations is also responsible, as well\n                  as predators such as sea lions and giant petrels, which prey on the chicks \n                  \t\t\n               </p>\n               \n               \t\t\n               <p class=\"p\">Climate change has displaced fish populations, so Magellanic penguins must swim an extra 25 miles (40 km) further from the\n                  nest for fish. While the penguins are swimming an extra 50 miles (80.4 km), their mates are sitting on a nest and starving.\n                  A colony being tracked by University of Washington professor P. Dee Boersma, about 1,000 miles (1,609 km) south of Buenos\n                  Aires, has fallen by more than 20 percent in the past 22 years, leaving 200,000 breeding pairs. Some younger penguins are\n                  now moving their breeding colonies north to be closer to fish, but, in some cases, this is putting them on private, unprotected\n                  lands. \n                  \t\t\n               </p>\n               \n               \t\t\n               <p class=\"p\">At present, 12 of 17 penguin species are experiencing rapid population declines. \n                  \t\t\n               </p>\n               \n               \t \n            </div>\n            \n            \n         </div>\n         \n         \n      </div>\n      \n      \n      <div class=\"topic nested1\" aria-labelledby=\"TOPIC_13B1F4249E454CB284AAC8BA96DE0B4A__GUID-83639C67-B735-41A5-BBBE-7D9DFD8FCC02\" id=\"TOPIC_13B1F4249E454CB284AAC8BA96DE0B4A\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"> \n         \n         <h2 class=\"title topictitle2\" id=\"TOPIC_13B1F4249E454CB284AAC8BA96DE0B4A__GUID-83639C67-B735-41A5-BBBE-7D9DFD8FCC02\">Behaviour</h2>\n         \n         \n         <div class=\"body\"> \n            \t \n            <div class=\"section\" id=\"TOPIC_13B1F4249E454CB284AAC8BA96DE0B4A__SECTION_096E2A02B53647E9BA0CC63B2F97939D\">\n               <h3 class=\"title sectiontitle\">Diet</h3> \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               <p class=\"p\">Magellanic penguins feed in the water, preying on cuttlefish, sardines, squid, krill, and other crustaceans, and ingest sea\n                  water with their prey.

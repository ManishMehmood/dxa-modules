The dorsal side\n                     and head are black and sharply delineated from the white belly, pale-yellow breast and bright-yellow ear patches. Like all\n                     penguins it is flightless, with a streamlined body, and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for a marine habitat.\n                     \n                     \t \n                  </p>\n                  \n                  \t \n                  <p class=\"p\">Its diet consists primarily of fish, but can also include crustaceans, such as krill, and cephalopods, such as squid.

It has several adaptations to facilitate\n                     this, including an unusually structured hemoglobin to allow it to function at low oxygen levels, solid bones to reduce barotrauma,\n                     and the ability to reduce its metabolism and shut down non-essential organ functions. \n                     \t \n                  </p>\n                  \n                  \t \n                  <p class=\"p\">The Emperor Penguin is perhaps best known for the sequence of journeys adults make each year in order to mate and to feed\n                     their offspring. The only penguin species that breeds during the Antarctic winter, it treks 50–120 km (31–75 mi) over the\n                     ice to breeding colonies which may include thousands of individuals. The female lays a single egg, which is incubated by the\n                     male while the female returns to the sea to feed; parents subsequently take turns foraging at sea and caring for their chick\n                     in the colony. The lifespan is typically 20 years in the wild, although observations suggest that some individuals may live\n                     to 50 years of age. \n                     \t \n                  </p>\n                  \n                  \t \n                  <div class=\"p\"> \n                     \t\t\n                     <div class=\"fig fignone\" id=\"d10e156\"><img class=\"image\" id=\"d10e157\" height=\"230\" width=\"208\" src=\"/gui/mocks/bin/1184146-515315-16.jpg\" /> \n                        \t\t\n                     </div>\n                     \n                     \t \n                  </div>\n                  \n                  \n               </div>\n               \n               \n            </div></tcdl:If>\n            \n         </div>\n         \n         <div class=\"topic concept glossgroup nested1\" aria-labelledby=\"GLOSSGROUP_DBA825B68A594A849963C08F61CA3AC6__GUID-D894166A-96CB-4530-B8CD-70C9AEFFA9CA\" id=\"GLOSSGROUP_DBA825B68A594A849963C08F61CA3AC6\"> \n            \n            <h2 class=\"title topictitle2\" id=\"GLOSSGROUP_DBA825B68A594A849963C08F61CA3AC6__GUID-D894166A-96CB-4530-B8CD-70C9AEFFA9CA\">Pygoscelis – Brush-tailed penguins </h2>\n            \n            \n            <tcdl:If type=\"ish:Condition\" condition=\"(Continents=Antarctica)\" xmlns:tcdl=\"http://www.sdl.com/web/DXA/Format\"><div class=\"topic concept glossentry nested2\" aria-labelledby=\"GLOSSENTRY_2DC939E94DC3454E9D16B58C9D675EDA__d10e43\" id=\"GLOSSENTRY_2DC939E94DC3454E9D16B58C9D675EDA\"> \n               \n               <h3 class=\"title title glossterm topictitle3\" id=\"GLOSSENTRY_2DC939E94DC3454E9D16B58C9D675EDA__d10e43\">Adélie Penguin, Pygoscelis adeliae \n                  \n               </h3>\n               \n               \n               <div class=\"abstract abstract glossdef\"> \n                  \t \n                  <p class=\"p\">The \n                     \t\t<samp class=\"ph msgph\">Adélie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)</samp> is a species of penguin common along the entire Antarctic coast.

Their name derives from the narrow black band under their heads which\n                     makes it appear as if they are wearing black helmets, making them one of the most easily identified types of penguin. Other\n                     names for them are \"Ringed Penguins\", \"Bearded Penguins\", and \"Stonecracker Penguins\" due to their harsh call. \n                     \t \n                  </p>\n                  \n                  \t \n                  <div class=\"fig fignone\" id=\"d10e109\"><img class=\"image\" id=\"d10e110\" height=\"320\" width=\"205\" src=\"/gui/mocks/bin/1184146-515319-16.jpg\" /> \n                     \t \n                  </div>\n                  \n                  \n               </div>\n               \n               \n            </div></tcdl:If>\n            \n            \n            <tcdl:If type=\"ish:Condition\" condition=\"(Continents in (Antarctica,'South America'))\" xmlns:tcdl=\"http://www.sdl.com/web/DXA/Format\"><div class=\"topic concept glossentry nested2\" aria-labelledby=\"GLOSSENTRY_EECC3B88C6C7412DB101010BD3AD7E1D__d10e244\" id=\"GLOSSENTRY_EECC3B88C6C7412DB101010BD3AD7E1D\"> \n               \n               <h3 class=\"title title glossterm topictitle3\" id=\"GLOSSENTRY_EECC3B88C6C7412DB101010BD3AD7E1D__d10e244\">Gentoo Penguin, Pygoscelis papua \n                  \n               </h3>\n               \n               \n               <div class=\"abstract abstract glossdef\"> \n                  \t \n                  <p class=\"p\">The long-tailed \n                     \t\t<samp class=\"ph msgph\">Gentoo Penguin (Pygoscelis papua)</samp>, is a penguin species in the genus Pygoscelis, most closely associated with the Adélie penguin (P. adeliae) and the Chinstrap\n                     penguin (P. antarcticus).

One of six species of crested penguin, it\n                     is very closely related to the Royal Penguin, and some authorities consider the two to be a single species. It bears a distinctive\n                     yellow crest, and the face and upperparts are black and sharply delineated from the white underparts. Adults weigh on average\n                     5.5 kg (12 lb) and are 70 cm (28 in) in length. The male and female are similar in appearance although the male is slightly\n                     larger with a relatively larger bill. Like all penguins, it is flightless, with a streamlined body and wings stiffened and\n                     flattened into flippers for a marine lifestyle. \n                     \t \n                  </p>\n                  \n                  \t \n                  <p class=\"p\">Its diet consists of a variety of crustaceans, mainly krill, as well as small fish and cephalopods; the species consumes more\n                     marine life annually than any other species of seabird. These birds moult once a year, spending about three to four weeks\n                     ashore, before returning to the sea. Numbering up to 100,000 individuals, the breeding colonies of the Macaroni Penguin are\n                     among the largest and densest of all penguin species. After spending the summer months breeding, penguins disperse into the\n                     oceans for six months; a 2009 study found that Macaroni Penguins from Kerguelen travelled over 10,000 km (6,200 mi) in the\n                     central Indian Ocean. With about 18 million individuals, the Macaroni Penguin is the most numerous penguin species. However,\n                     widespread declines in populations have been recorded since the mid-1970s. These factors resulted in their conservation status\n                     being reclassified as vulnerable. \n                     \t \n                  </p>\n                  \n                  \t \n                  <div class=\"fig fignone\" id=\"d10e373\"><img class=\"image\" id=\"d10e374\" height=\"203\" width=\"166\" src=\"/gui/mocks/bin/1184146-515311-16.jpg\" /> \n                     \t \n                  </div>\n                  \n                  \n               </div>\n               \n               \n            </div></tcdl:If>\n            \n            \n            <tcdl:If type=\"ish:Condition\" condition=\"(Continents=Oceania)\" xmlns:tcdl=\"http://www.sdl.com/web/DXA/Format\"><div class=\"topic concept glossentry nested2\" aria-labelledby=\"GUID-715A6DDB-2927-455B-BA1C-6E474E573AE5__d10e86\" id=\"GUID-715A6DDB-2927-455B-BA1C-6E474E573AE5\"> \n               \n               <h3 class=\"title title glossterm topictitle3\" id=\"GUID-715A6DDB-2927-455B-BA1C-6E474E573AE5__d10e86\">Chatham Penguin, Eudyptes chathamensis (extinct) \n                  \n               </h3>\n               \n               \n               <div class=\"abstract abstract glossdef\"> \n                  \t \n                  <p class=\"p\">The Chatham Penguin (Eudyptes chathamensis) was a species of penguin, now extinct.

The word \"jaeger\" is derived from the\n               German word Jäger, meaning \"hunter\". \n               \t\t\n            </p>\n            \n            \t\t\n            <p class=\"p\">Skuas nest on the ground in temperate and Arctic regions, and are long-distance migrants.

Many are partial kleptoparasites, comprising up to 95% of\n               the feeding methods of wintering birds, by chasing gulls, terns and other seabirds to steal their catches, regardless of the\n               size of the species attacked (up to 3 times heavier than the attacking skua). The larger species, such as the great skua,\n               also regularly kill and eat adult birds, such as puffins and gulls, and have been recorded as killing birds as large as a\n               grey heron. On the breeding grounds, the three, more slender Northern breeding species commonly eat lemmings. Those species\n               that breed in the Southern Oceans, largely feed on fish that can be caught near their colonies. The eggs and young of other\n               birds are an important food source for most skua species during the nesting season. In the Southern oceans and Antarctica\n               region, some skua species (especially the South Polar skua) will readily scavenge the carcasses at breeding colonies of penguins\n               and pinnipeds, sometimes taking live penguin chicks. In these areas, skuas seem to defer to the considerably larger giant\n               petrels. \n               \t\t\n            </p>\n            \n            \t\t\n            <p class=\"p\">They are medium to large birds, typically with grey or brown plumage, often with white markings on the wings. The skuas range\n               in size from the long-tailed skua, \n               \t\t  <em class=\"ph i\">Stercorarius longicauda</em>, at 310 grams (11 oz), to the brown skua, \n               \t\t  <em class=\"ph i\">Stercorarius antarcticus</em>, at 1.63 kg (3.6 lb). On average, a skua is about 56 cm (22 in) long, and 121 cm (48 in) across the wings. They have longish\n               bills with a hooked tip, and webbed feet with sharp claws. They look like large dark gulls, but have a fleshy cere above the\n               upper mandible. The skuas are strong, acrobatic fliers. They are generally aggressive in disposition. Potential predators\n               who go near their nest will be quickly dived at by the parent bird, which usually targets the head of the intruder - a practice\n               known as 'dive bombing' \n               \t\t\n            </p>\n            \n            \t \n         </div>\n         \n         \n      </div>\n      \n      \n      <div class=\"related-links\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n         \n         <ul class=\"ullinks\">\n            \n            <li class=\"link ulchildlink\"><strong><a href=\"/1184146/515702/penguin-publication/south-polar-skua--stercorarius-maccormicki-\">South polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki)</a></strong><br />\n               \n            </li>\n            \n         </ul>\n         \n         \n         <div class=\"familylinks\">\n            \n            <div class=\"parentlink\"><strong>Parent topic:</strong> <a class=\"link\" title=\"This topic groups birds of other orders which are predators of penguins or have another relation with the penguins\" href=\"/1184146/515736/penguin-publication/other-birds\">Other birds</a></div>\n            \n         </div>\n         \n      </div>\n   "

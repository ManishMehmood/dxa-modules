Storks have no syrinx and are mute, giving\n            no call; bill-clattering is an important mode of communication at the nest. Many species are migratory. Most storks eat frogs,\n            fish, insects, earthworms, small birds and small mammals. There are nineteen living species of storks in six genera. \n            \t \n         </p>\n         \n         \t \n         <p class=\"p\">Storks tend to use soaring, gliding flight, which conserves energy. Soaring requires thermal air currents. Storks are heavy,\n            with wide wingspans: the marabou stork, with a wingspan of 3.2 metres (10.5 feet) and weight up to 8 kg (18 lbs), joins the\n            \n            \t\t<a class=\"xref\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andean_condor\" target=\"_blank\">Andean condor</a> in having the widest wingspan of all living land birds. \n            \t \n         </p>\n         \n         \t \n         <p class=\"p\">Their nests are often very large and may be used for many years. Some nests have been known to grow to over two metres (six\n            feet) in diameter and about three metres (ten feet) in depth. Storks were once thought to be monogamous, but this is only\n            partially true. They may change mates after migrations, and may migrate without a mate. They tend to be attached to nests\n            as much as partners. \n            \t \n         </p>\n         \n         \t \n         <p class=\"p\">Storks' size, serial monogamy, and faithfulness to an established nesting site contribute to their prominence in mythology\n            and culture. \n            \t \n         </p>\n         \n         \t \n         <p class=\"p\">For more information: \n            \t\t<a class=\"xref\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stork\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stork</a> \n            \t \n         </p>\n         \n         \n      </div>\n      \n      \n      <div class=\"related-links\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n         \n         <div class=\"familylinks\">\n            \n            <div class=\"parentlink\"><strong>Parent topic:</strong> <a class=\"link\" title=\"This topic groups birds of other orders which are predators of penguins or have another relation with the penguins\" href=\"/1184146/515736/penguin-publication/storks\">Other birds</a></div>\n            \n         </div>\n         \n      </div>\n   "

They exhibit very little sexual dimorphism in size. The\n            necks are able to kink in an S-shape, due to the modified shape of the sixth vertebrae. The neck is able to retract and extend,\n            and is retracted during flight, unlike most other long-necked birds. The legs are long and strong and in almost every species\n            are unfeathered from the lower part of the tibia. In flight the legs and feet are held backward. The feet of herons have long\n            thin toes, with three forward pointing ones and one going backward. \n            \t \n         </p>\n         \n         \t \n         <div class=\"p\"> \n            \t\t\n            <div class=\"fig fignone\" id=\"FIG_D9B75A203D374E40B34F4B9A7D2E408F\"> \n               \t\t  <img class=\"image\" id=\"IMAGE_ED97C78F6E314C858C640971205F3816\" src=\"/app/gui/mocks/bin/1601084-515542-16.jpg\" /> \n               \t\t\n            </div>\n            \n            \t \n         </div>\n         \n         \t \n         <p class=\"p\">The bill is generally long and harpoon like. It can vary from extremely fine, as in the agami heron, to thick as in the grey\n            heron. The most atypical bill is owned by the boat-billed heron, which has a broad thick bill. The bill, as well as other\n            bare parts of the body, is usually yellow, black or brown coloured, although this colour can vary during the breeding season.\n            The wings are broad and long, exhibiting 10-11 primaries feathers (the boat-billed heron has only nine), 15-20 secondaries\n            and 12 rectrices (10 in the bitterns). The feathers of the herons are soft and the plumage is usually blue, black, brown,\n            grey or white, and can often be strikingly complex. Amongst the day herons there is little sexual dimorphism in plumage (except\n            in the pond-herons); differences between the sexes are the rule for the night herons and smaller bitterns. Many species also\n            have different colour morphs. In the Pacific reef heron there are both dark and light colour morphs, and the percentage of\n            each morph varies geographically. White morphs only occur in areas with coral beaches \n            \t \n         </p>\n         \n         \t \n         <p class=\"p\">For more information: \n            \t\t<a class=\"xref\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron</a> \n            \t \n         </p>\n         \n         \n      </div>\n      \n      \n      <div class=\"related-links\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n         \n         <div class=\"familylinks\">\n            \n            <div class=\"parentlink\"><strong>Parent topic:</strong> <a class=\"link\" title=\"This topic groups birds of other orders which are predators of penguins or have another relation with the penguins\" href=\"/1601084/515736/penguin-publication/other-birds\">Other birds</a></div>\n            \n         </div>\n         \n      </div>\n   "

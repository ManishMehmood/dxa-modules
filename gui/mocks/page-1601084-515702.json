Adults are greyish brown\n               above, and have a whitish (pale morph) or straw-brown (intermediate morph) head and underparts, and the contrast between head\n               and body makes it easy to separate from similar species with good views. Juveniles and adult dark morphs are harder to distinguish\n               from their relatives, and more subjective or difficult-to-observe criteria, such as the colder brown plumage and blue bill\n               base, must be used. \n               \t\t\n            </p>\n            \n            \t\t\n            <div class=\"p\"> \n               \t\t  \n               <div class=\"fig fignone\" id=\"GUID-96AE7103-DC19-44F9-B4B6-E24451A5C78F__FIG_86B798AACA7A4284A214752F4A9CC266\"> \n                  \t\t  \n               </div>\n               \n               \t\t\n            </div>\n            \n            \t \n         </div>\n         \n         \n      </div>\n      \n      \n      <div class=\"related-links\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n         \n         <div class=\"familylinks\">\n            \n            <div class=\"parentlink\"><strong>Parent topic:</strong> <a class=\"link\" href=\"/app/1601084/515761/penguin-guide/skuas\">Skuas</a></div>\n            \n         </div>\n         \n      </div>\n   "

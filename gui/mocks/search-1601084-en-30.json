Analysis of\n               a part of a mitochondrial control region from a Northern Rockhopper Penguin found on the Kerguelen Islands showed that it\n               may have come from Gough Island, 6,000 km away, and that the Southern and Northern Rockhoppers are genetically separate, though\n               some individuals may disperse from their breeding colonies.

It appears to have been a distinct species, with a thin, slim and low bill. As of 2009, the species\n                  has not been formally described.

In New Zealand, they are also called Little Blue Penguins, or just Blue Penguins, owing to their slate-blue\n                  plumage, and they are called Korora in Maori. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n                \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n      \n      \n       \n         \n         M\n         \n         \n          \n            \n            Macaroni Penguin, Eudyptes chrysolophus \n               \n            \n            \n            \n             \n               \t \n               The \n                  \t\tMacaroni Penguin (Eudyptes chrysolophus) is a species of penguin found from the Subantarctic to the Antarctic Peninsula. One of six species of crested penguin, it\n                  is very closely related to the Royal Penguin, and some authorities consider the two to be a single species. It bears a distinctive\n                  yellow crest, and the face and upperparts are black and sharply delineated from the white underparts. Adults weigh on average\n                  5.5 kg (12 lb) and are 70 cm (28 in) in length. The male and female are similar in appearance although the male is slightly\n                  larger with a relatively larger bill. Like all penguins, it is flightless, with a streamlined body and wings stiffened and\n                  flattened into flippers for a marine lifestyle. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n               Its diet consists of a variety of crustaceans, mainly krill, as well as small fish and cephalopods; the species consumes more\n                  marine life annually than any other species of seabird. These birds moult once a year, spending about three to four weeks\n                  ashore, before returning to the sea. Numbering up to 100,000 individuals, the breeding colonies of the Macaroni Penguin are\n                  among the largest and densest of all penguin species. After spending the summer months breeding, penguins disperse into the\n                  oceans for six months; a 2009 study found that Macaroni Penguins from Kerguelen travelled over 10,000 km (6,200 mi) in the\n                  central Indian Ocean. With about 18 million individuals, the Macaroni Penguin is the most numerous penguin species. However,\n                  widespread declines in populations have been recorded since the mid-1970s. These factors resulted in their conservation status\n                  being reclassified as vulnerable. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n                \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n          \n            \n            Magellanic Penguin, Spheniscus magellanicus \n               \n            \n            \n            \n             \n               \t \n               The \n                  \t\tMagellanic Penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus)is a South American penguin, breeding in coastal Argentina, Chile and the Falkland Islands, with some migrating to Brazil\n                  where they are occasionally seen as far north as Rio de Janeiro.

They vary in size from about 11 to 45 cm (4 to 18 inches)\n            in length. Their loud calls reveal their presence in dense vegetation. Many are excellent game birds; when flushed, they take\n            wing reluctantly, fly a short distance, and then drop to the ground. Their slender build facilitates running through reeds\n            and marsh grasses. They are mostly dull coloured in grays and browns. Many are barred in irregular patterns.

The species breeds\n               on The Snares, a group of islands off the southern coast of the South Island. This is a medium-small, yellow-crested penguin,\n               at a size of 50-70 cm (20-28 in) and a weight of 2.5-4 kg (5.5-8.8 lbs).

The Snares penguin's\n               main prey is krill, supplemented by squid and small fish.

However, Hutton lost his sample at sea before a full speciation could be identified. A description\n               written by Hutton and an illustration done by Keulemans in Buller's \"A History of the Birds of New Zealand\" are evidence that\n               this is the same penguin previously identified by Hutton. However, there is some debate over the classification of this penguin,\n               and Oliver was able to successfully propose that a few slight anatomical differences did exist between the Snares penguins\n               and the early description and illustration, leading the Snares penguin to be called \n               \t\trobustus instead of \n               \t\tatratus. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n       \n         \n         Description\n         \n         \n          \n            \t \n            The Snares penguin is often compared to \n               \t\tFiordland penguin (Eudyptes pachyrhynchus), which is related by the genus of Crested Penguins (Eudyptes). Snares penguins can be distinguished from Fiordland penguins\n               by a patch of skin at the base of their beaks. The Snares penguin is similarly colored to other species of penguins, having\n               a black head, back and flippers with a white belly. A bright-yellow crest, beginning at the base of the bill, runs along the\n               upper part of the head on both sides and ends at the back of the head. It has a thick reddish-brown beak, traced with light\n               pink skin at the base. The eyes are generally described as a bright red-brown color, but this coloration can vary somewhat\n               between individuals and in different lighting. The color patterns under the wings differ from individual to individual, so\n               it is not a good characteristic for species identification. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            The penguin can make a large variety of vocal noises. It is difficult to verbally describe these noises, but they range from\n               hisses and explosive cries when threatened to rhythmical braying and trumpeting sounds that can be heard from long distances\n               at sea. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n       \n         \n         Distribution and habitat\n         \n         \n          \n             \n               \t \n               The Snares penguin is named after the place in which it breeds-the Snares Islands. The Snares Islands are a small group of\n                  islands off the coast of southern New Zealand. Although little is known of their range and migration outside of the breeding\n                  season, it is not thought that they migrate far in the winters. Occasional sitings have occurred on the coasts of Tasmania,\n                  southern Australia, the Chatham Islands, Stewart Island, and the southern New Zealand mainland. There are approximately 25,000\n                  living pairs of Snares penguins. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n               Snares penguins nest in dense colonies under the tree cover of the Olearia forests or on coastal rocks. To build a nest, the\n                  penguins dig up shallow holes in the ground and layer the bottom with grass, leaves, twigs, peat, or pebbles. A small rim\n                  of mud is added to the rim of the nest to raise it above ground level. Vegetation at nesting sites dies dues to the dense\n                  nesting activities, and the colony moves to a new nesting site. Colonies nesting near streams may have some advantage, as\n                  the stream provides water for drinking and bathing. However, it is not essential that nesting colonies are located near a\n                  stream since many are far from any streams. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n             \n            \t \n            \n               Conservation \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               Although Snares penguins are not currently threatened, they are considered a vulnerable species. If a threat arose, it could\n                  quickly wipe out their population because their breeding grounds are confined to a small island group. Possible threats include\n                  the introduction of a new predator, overfishing around the islands that would deplete their food source, increasing water\n                  temperatures from global warming driving prey away, and pollution. The New Zealand government has taken action to protect\n                  the Snares Islands habitats and marine feeding grounds. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n       \n         \n         Behavior\n         \n         \n          \n            \t \n            \n               Diet \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               The diet of Snares penguins usually consists of krill of the species Nyctiphanes australis, small fish, and cephalopods. One\n                  study found that about 60 percent of the mass of stomach contents from Snares penguins consisted of krill, 30 percent was\n                  fish, and about 10 percent was cephalopods. The researchers concluded that the number of fish otoliths and cephalopod beaks\n                  indicated the importance of these types of prey to adult penguins while at sea. Another study reports the diet consisting\n                  of about 55 percent krill, 24 percent fish, and 21 percent cephalopods, also suggesting that fish and cephalopods are more\n                  important prey types than the percentages of stomach composition indicate. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            \n               Foraging Ecology \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               The foraging patterns of breeding Snares penguins is well defined. After shared incubation of eggs, males leave on two week\n                  long foraging trips, which has been found to be synchronized with spring plankton blooms, as they are reliable predictors\n                  of food sources . Upon the return of the males, the females go on somewhat shorter foraging trips (less than a week), returning\n                  in time for the chicks to hatch. Throughout the chick guard stage, the female is the lone provider of food performing short\n                  foraging trips (one to three days). While male penguins performing long foraging trips reach depths of up to 120m, chick rearing\n                  birds usually exhibit shallow pursuit diving strategies (average dive depths 20-40m) to catch prey . \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            \n               Predators \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               Predators of adult Snares penguins are sea lions and leopard seals.

Snares penguins begin reproducing in the age range of five to nine years old. To court the females, single males\n                  stand erect with their wings spread out and pumping their chest. It is likely that the pairs remain faithful to each other\n                  for more than one season. The pairs then build a nest, most of the work being done by the male. The female lays two eggs,\n                  typically about three to five days apart, which hatch 31-37 days later. The second laid egg is up to 85 percent larger than\n                  the first and also hatches first. The smaller, last-hatched chick is outcompeted by its siblings and usually does not survive,\n                  also called \"siblicide\". Egg-size dimorphism is particularly large in Snares penguins, and the larger egg hatching first only\n                  accentuates the sibling size difference. Hatching pattern and size-dimorphic eggs are two of the mechanisms by which birds\n                  can change their breeding pattern in response to environmental and breeding conditions. In altricial birds, such as Snares\n                  penguins, egg-size variation and asynchronous hatching are adaptive mechanisms that may lead to brood reduction. However,\n                  Snares penguins and other members of their genus, \n                  \t\t  Eudyptes, differ from most other birds in that their last laid egg is larger and hatches first rather than being the smallest and\n                  last to hatch. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n                Egg incubation does not occur until both eggs have been laid, and they are usually incubated one in front of the other. The\n                  smaller, first-laid egg is often placed in the anterior position for incubation, which is thought to be the less favorable\n                  location since they have lower and more variable temperatures during incubation. Although the smaller, first egg receives\n                  less favorable incubation, it was found that egg-size dimorphism affects the hatching pattern in Snares penguins instead of\n                  egg incubation position. Both parents partake in incubating the eggs. For the first ten days, they alternate. Then the male\n                  leaves for an extended period (about 12 days) to forage for food, while the mother stays with the eggs. When he returns, the\n                  roles are reversed. Also, upon his return, the pair engages in a display of bowing and trumpeting, which further strengthens\n                  their bond. For the first three weeks after hatching, the male guards the chicks from predators while the female searches\n                  for food, returning each day to feed her offspring. It was observed that parents can recognize their chicks and chicks can\n                  recognize their parents. The study found that calls between chick and parent were more important for recognition than visual\n                  cues. The parents provide food for their young each day until it has molted and can forage for its own food. The chicks fledge\n                  at approximately 11 weeks. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n   ",

Fossil evidence of a third species-Ridgen's Penguin (A. ridgeni)-has\n                  been found in fossil records from the late Pliocene, about three million years ago, in New Zealand. Studies of penguin behaviour\n                  and genetics have proposed that the genus Aptenodytes is basal; in other words, that it split off from a branch which led to all other living penguin species. Mitochondrial and\n                  nuclear DNA evidence suggests this split occurred around 40 million years ago. \n               \n               \n               \t\t\t\n            \n            \t\t\t\n            \n               Subspecies\n               In 1911, the ornithologist Gregory Mathews proposed the two subspecies currently recognised: \n               \n                \n                  \n                     \t\t\t\t\n                      A. p. patagonicus breeds on South Georgia and Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic. \n                     \n                     \n                     \t\t\t\t\n                      A. p. halli breeds on the Kerguelen, Crozet Prince Edward, Heard, and Macquarie Islands. \n                     \n                     \n                     \t\t\t\n                  \n                  \n               \n               \n            \n            \n            \t\t\n         \n         \n         \t\n      \n      \n      \t\n      \n         \t\t\n          Description\n         \n         \t\t\n         \n            \t\t\t\n            \n               \t\t\t\t\n               The king penguin is the second largest species of penguin at about 90 cm (3.0 ft) tall and weighing 11 to 16 kg (24 to 35\n                  lb), second only to the Emperor Penguin. Like all penguin species, it has a streamlined body to minimise drag while swimming,\n                  webbed feet to propel more force when swimming, and wings that have become stiff, flat flippers. There is little difference\n                  in plumage between the male and female, although the latter are slightly smaller. The upper parts features of the king penguin\n                  include a silvery-grey back with a blackish-brown head decorated with ear patches of bright golden-orange. However, rare individuals\n                  have been sighted that have varying degrees of melanism, including one individual spotted on a National Geographic Society expedition to South Georgia Island that was completely black. The 12-13 cm (4¾-5 in) black bill is long and slender, and\n                  curved downwards like a banana peel. The lower mandible bears a striking pink or orange-coloured mandibular plate. \n               \n               \n               \t\t\t\t\n               \n                  \t\t\t\t\t\n                  \t\t\t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\t\t\n               The chick is not the first covered with brown-grey down, before moulting into a thick, woolly brown coat borne until around\n                  10-12 months of age. Their mandibular plates are black until the moult into immature plumage. An immature bird will have yellow,\n                  rather than orange-tinged markings, and grey tips to its black brown feathers. It moults into adult plumage after reaching\n                  two years of age. \n               \n               \n               \t\t\t\t\n               King penguins live for an average of 15 to 20 years in the wild. \n               \n               \t\t\t\n            \n            \t\t\t\n            \n                Adaptations to the environment\n               King penguins have adapted well to their extreme living conditions in the subantarctic. To keep warm, the penguins have four\n                  layers of feathering. King penguins have 70 feathers per every square inch. The outer layer of feathers are oiled and waterproof,\n                  unlike the feathering of a duck, which reduces the amount of water absorbed that would otherwise increase their weight. The\n                  inner three layers are down feathers, very effective insulation. A chick is born without the oily outer layer, and therefore\n                  cannot fish until immaturity. A king penguin chick has dark down feathers. They remain on land and do not go into the water\n                  until their down feathers have fallen off. \n               \n               \n            \n            \n            \t\t\t\n            \n                Drinking\n               Like most penguins, king penguins are able to drink salt water because of their supraorbital glands which filter excess salt\n                  from their blood stream by way of a capillary just above the eyes. The excess salt is then expelled through the nostrils as\n                  a concentrated brine. \n               \n               \n            \n            \n            \t\t\n         \n         \n         \t\n      \n      \n      \t\n      \n         \t\t\n          Distribution and habitat\n         \n         \t\t\n         \n            \t\t\t\n            King penguins breed on subantarctic islands between 45 and 55°S, at the northern reaches of Antarctica, as well as Tierra\n               del Fuego, the Falkland Islands, and other temperate islands of the region. The total population is estimated to be 2.23 million\n               pairs and is increasing. The largest breeding populations are on Crozet Island, with around 455,000 pairs, 228,000 pairs on\n               the Prince Edward Islands, 240,000-280,000 on the Kerguelen Islands and over 100,000 on the South Georgia Islands. Macquarie\n               Island has around 70,000 pairs. The non-breeding range is poorly known though presumably the subantarctic waters of the southern\n               Indian, South Atlantic and Asian part of the Southern Ocean. Vagrant birds have been recorded from the Antarctic peninsula\n               as well as South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. \n            \n            \n            \t\t\t\n            The Nature Protection Society released king penguins in Gjesvær in Finnmark, and Røst in Lofoten in northern Norway in August\n               1936. Birds were reported in the area several times in the 1940s though none have been seen since 1949. \n            \n            \n            \t\t\t\n            \n               \t\t\t\t\n               \t\t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n         \n         \n         \t\n      \n      \n      \t\n      \n         \t\t\n          Behavior\n         \n         \t\t\n         \n            \t\t\t\n            \n               \t\t\t\t\n               American zoologist Gerry Kooyman revolutionized the study of penguin foraging behaviour in 1971 when he published his results\n                  from attaching automatic dive-recording devices to Emperor Penguins, and recording a dive of 235 metres (771 ft) by a king\n                  penguin in 1982. The current maximum dive recorded is 343 metres in the Falkland Islands region, and a maximum time submerged\n                  of 552 seconds recorded at the Crozet Islands. The king penguin dives to depths of 100-300 meters (350-1000 feet), spending\n                  around 5 minutes submerged, during daylight hours, and less than 30 metres (98 ft) at night. \n               \n               \n               \t\t\t\t\n               The majority (around 88% in one study) of dives undertaken by king penguins are flat-bottomed; that is, the penguin dives\n                  to a certain depth and remains there for a period of time hunting (roughly 50% of total dive time) before returning to the\n                  surface. They have been described as U-shaped or W-shaped, relating to the course of the dive. The bird dives in a V-shaped\n                  or 'spike' pattern in the remaining 12% of dives; that is the bird dives at an angle through the water column, reaches a certain\n                  depth and then returns to the surface. Other penguins dive in this latter foraging pattern in contrast. Observations at Crozet\n                  Islands revealed most King penguins were seen within 30 km (19 mi) of the colony. Using the average swimming speed, Kooyman\n                  estimated the distance travelled to foraging areas at 28 km (17 mi). \n               \n               \n               \t\t\t\t\n               Its average swimming speed is 6.5-10 km/h (4-6 mph). On shallower dives under 60 m (200 ft), it averages 2 km/h (1.2 mph)\n                  descending and ascending, while on deeper dives over 150 m (490 ft) deep, it averages 5 km/h (3.1 mph) in both directions.\n                  King penguins also porpoise, a swimming technique used to breathe while maintaining speed. On land, the king penguin alternates\n                  between walking with a wobbling gait and tobogganing-sliding over the ice on its belly, propelled by its feet and wing-like\n                  flippers. Like all penguins, it is flightless \n               \n               \n               \t\t\t\n            \n            \t\t\t\n            \n                Diet King penguins eat small fish, and squid and rely less than most Southern Ocean predators on krill and other crustaceans.\n               Fish constitute 80-100% of the diet, except in winter months of July and August, when they make up only 30%. Lanternfish are\n               the main fish taken, principally the species Electrona carlsbergi and Krefftichthys anderssoni, as well as Protomyctophum\n               tenisoni. Slender escolar ( Paradiplospinus gracilis) of the Gempylidae, and Champsocephalus gunneri, is also consumed. Cephalopods\n               consumed include those of the genus Moroteuthis , the Nopehooked squid species Kondakovia longimana, the Sevenstar Flying\n               Squid (Martialia hyadesii ), young Gonatus antarcticus and Onychoteuthis species \n            \n            \n            \t\t\t\n            \n                Predators\n               The King Penguin's predators include birds and aquatic mammals: \n               \n                \n                  \n                     \t\t\t\t\n                      Skuas take small chicks and eggs. \n                     \n                     \n                     \t\t\t\t\n                     The Snowy sheathbill (Chionis albus) scavenges for dead chicks and unattended eggs. \n                     \n                     \n                     \t\t\t\t\n                     The Leopard Seal (Hydrurga leptonyx) takes adult birds at sea. \n                     \n                     \t\t\t\t\n                      Orcas may also hunt king penguins. \n                     \n                     \t\t\t\t\n                      Antarctic Fur Seals on Marion Island have also been seen chasing king penguins on the beach, killing and eating them. It\n                        seems that especially males, and particularly sub-adults males, are involved \n                     \n                     \n                     \t\t\t\n                  \n                  \n               \n               \n            \n            \n            \t\t\t\n            \n                Courtship and breeding\n               The king penguin is able to breed at three years of age, although only a very small minority (5% recorded at Crozet Islands)\n                  actually do then; the average age of first breeding is around 6 years. King penguins are serially monogamous. They have only\n                  one mate each year, and stay faithful to that mate. However, fidelity between years is only about 29%. The long breeding cycle\n                  may contribute to this low rate. \n               \n               \n               The king penguin has an unusually prolonged breeding cycle, taking some 14-16 months from laying to offspring fledging. Although\n                  pairs will attempt to breed annually, they are generally only successful one year in two, or two years in three in a triennial\n                  pattern on South Georgia. The reproductive cycle begins in September to November, as birds return to colonies for a prenuptial\n                  moult. Those that were unsuccessful in breeding the previous season will often arrive earlier. They then return to the sea\n                  for three weeks before coming ashore in November or December. \n               \n               \n               \n                  \t\t\t\t\n                  \t\t\t\n               \n               \n                The female penguin lays one pyriform (pear-shaped) white egg weighing 300 g (⅔ lb). It is initially soft, but hardens and\n                  darkens to a pale greenish colour. It measures around 10 cm × 7 cm (3.9 in × 2.8 in). The egg is incubated for around 55 days\n                  with both birds sharing incubation in shifts of 6-18 days each. Hatching may take up to 2-3 days to complete, and chicks are\n                  born semi-altricial and nidicolous. In other words, they have only a thin covering of down and are entirely dependent on their\n                  parents for food and warmth. The guard phase starts with the birth of the chick. The young chick is spends its time balanced\n                  on its parents' feet and is sheltered by its pouch (abdominal skin). During this time, the parents alternate every 3-7 days,\n                  one guarding the chick while the other forages. The guard phase lasts for 30-40 days. By then the chick has grown much bigger,\n                  can keep itself warm and protect itself against most predators. It becomes more curious and starts to explore its surroundings.\n                  It ends up forming a group with other chicks, a so-called crèche. Crèches are guarded by only a few adult birds; most parents\n                  can leave their chick to forage for themselves and their chick. Other species of penguins also practice this method of communal\n                  care for offspring. \n               \n               \n               By April the chicks are almost fully grown, but lose weight by fasting over the winter months, gaining it again during spring\n                  in September. Fledging then takes place in late spring/early summer. \n               \n               \n               King penguins form huge breeding colonies; for example, the colony on South Georgia Island at Salisbury Plain holds over 100,000\n                  breeding pairs and the one at St. Andrew's Bay over 100,000 birds. Because of the long breeding cycle, colonies are continuously\n                  occupied. \n               \n               \n               \n                  \t\t\t\t\n                  \t\t\t\n               \n               \n               The king penguin feeds its chicks by eating a fish, digesting it slightly and regurgitating the food into the chick's mouth.\n                  \n               \n               \n               \n                  \t\t\t\t\n                  \t\t\t\n               \n               \n               Because of their large size, king penguin chicks take 14-16 months before they are ready to go to sea. This is markedly different\n                  from smaller penguins, who rear their chicks through a single summer when food is plentiful. King penguins time their mating\n                  so the chicks will develop over the harshest season for fishing. In this way, by the time the young penguins are finally mature\n                  enough to leave their parents, it is summer when food is plentiful and conditions are more favorable for the young to survive\n                  alone. \n               \n               \n            \n            \n            \t\t\n         \n         \n         \t\n      \n      \n      \n   ",

Their vestigial wings have become flippers, useless for flight in the air.\n               In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Penguins' swimming looks very similar to bird's flight in the air.\n               Within the smooth plumage a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold\n               waters. On land, penguins use their tails and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance. \n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n             \n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n            All penguins are countershaded for camouflage – that is, they have black backs and wings with white fronts. A predator looking\n               up from below (such as an orca or a leopard seal) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective\n               water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above. \n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n            Diving penguins reach 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph), though there are reports of velocities of 27 km/h (17 mph) (which are\n               more realistic in the case of startled flight). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the\n               surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Dives of the large\n               Emperor Penguin have been recorded reaching a depth of 565 m (1,870 ft) for up to 22 minutes. \n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n            Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called \"tobogganing\", which conserves\n               energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky\n               terrain. \n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n            Penguins have an average sense of hearing for birds;[33] this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded\n               colonies. Their eyes are adapted for underwater vision, and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators;\n               in air it has been suggested that they are nearsighted, although research has not supported this hypothesis.\n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n            Penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers that keeps them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater than\n               in air). The Emperor Penguin (the largest penguin) has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative\n               surface area and heat loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood that\n               gets cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females are at\n               sea fishing for food leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to keep warm and rotate\n               positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the center of the heat pack.\n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n            They can drink salt water because their supraorbital gland filters excess salt from the bloodstream. The salt is excreted\n               in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages.\n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n            The Great Auk of the Northern Hemisphere, now extinct, was superficially similar to penguins, and the word \"penguin\" was originally\n               used for that bird, centuries ago. They are not related to the penguins at all, but are an example of convergent evolution.\n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         \n            Isabelline penguins\n            \t\t\n            \t\t\n            Perhaps one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage. These are called isabelline\n               penguins, possibly in reference to the legend that the archduchess Isabella of Austria vowed not to change her undergarments\n               until her husband's siege of Ostend was successful—which took over three years to accomplish. Isabellinism is different from\n               albinism. Isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the\n               deep, and are often passed over as mates.\n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n            \n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n         \n         \n            \n            Parent topic: Penguins Overview\n            \n         \n         \n      \n   ",

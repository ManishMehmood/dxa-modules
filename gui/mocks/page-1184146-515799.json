The moment any small aquatic creature touches the inside of the bill-an insect, crustacean, or tiny fish-it\n            is snapped shut. Spoonbills generally prefer fresh water to salt but are found in both environments. They need to feed many\n            hours each day. \n            \t \n         </p>\n         \n         \t \n         <p class=\"p\">Spoonbills are monogamous, but, so far as is known, only for one season at a time. Most species nest in trees or reed beds,\n            often with \n            \t\t<a class=\"xref\" href=\"/1184146/515654/penguin-publication/spoonbills\">Ibis</a> or \n            \t\t<a class=\"xref\" href=\"/1184146/515903/penguin-publication/spoonbills\">Herons</a>. The male gathers nesting material-mostly sticks and reeds, sometimes taken from an old nest. The female weaves it into a\n            large, shallow bowl or platform which varies in its shape and structural integrity according to species. \n            \t \n         </p>\n         \n         \t \n         <div class=\"p\"> \n            \t\t\n            <div class=\"fig fignone\" id=\"FIG_8BE05A500DE24A54903A0554F3DFBE61\">\n               <img class=\"image\" id=\"IMAGE_64FF382916EE4AAEB9611D2E82A5F879\" src=\"/gui/mocks/bin/1184146-515523-16.jpg\" /> \n               \t\t\n            </div>\n            \n            \t \n         </div>\n         \n         \t \n         <p class=\"p\">For more information: \n            \t\t<a class=\"xref\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoonbill\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoonbill</a> \n            \t \n         </p>\n         \n         \n      </div>\n      \n      \n      <div class=\"related-links\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n         \n         <div class=\"familylinks\">\n            \n            <div class=\"parentlink\"><strong>Parent topic:</strong> <a class=\"link\" title=\"This topic groups birds of other orders which are predators of penguins or have another relation with the penguins\" href=\"/1184146/515736/penguin-publication/spoonbills\">Other birds</a></div>\n            \n         </div>\n         \n      </div>\n   "

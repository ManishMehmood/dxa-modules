Coots and gallinules swim in open water,\n            and waddle conspicuously on shore. By contrast, rails are secretive birds, hiding among reeds at the water's edge by day and\n            uttering their calls mostly at night. \n            \t \n         </p>\n         \n         \t \n         <p class=\"p\">Rails are distributed throughout the world, except in high latitudes. They vary in size from about 11 to 45 cm (4 to 18 inches)\n            in length. Their loud calls reveal their presence in dense vegetation. Many are excellent game birds; when flushed, they take\n            wing reluctantly, fly a short distance, and then drop to the ground. Their slender build facilitates running through reeds\n            and marsh grasses. They are mostly dull coloured in grays and browns. Many are barred in irregular patterns. Short-billed\n            species are often called crakes. \n            \t \n         </p>\n         \n         \t \n         <p class=\"p\">Rails hunted as game in the United States are the king rail (Rallus elegans), a reddish brown bird the size of a small chicken;\n            the clapper rail (R. longirostris), a grayer form; the Virginia rail (R. limicola), reddish brown and about 25 cm (10 inches)\n            in length; and the sora. The little yellow rail (Coturnicops noveboracensis) and the American black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis)\n            are too scarce and too small (about 15 cm [6 inches]) to be of interest to the hunter. \n            \t \n         </p>\n         \n         \t \n         <p class=\"p\">The corncrake, or land rail (Crex crex), is a widespread European crake.

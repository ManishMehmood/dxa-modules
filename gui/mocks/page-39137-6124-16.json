Take this into account when\r\n            performing other operations with your phone.\r\n         </p>\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"p\">There may be restrictions on using devices using Bluetooth technology. Check with your local authorities.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"p\">When you receive data via Bluetooth, a tone sound is played and you are asked if you want to accept the message. If you accept,\r\n            the item is placed in the Inbox folder in Messaging.\r\n         </p>\r\n\t\t\t<p class=\"p\">A Bluetooth connection is disconnected automatically after sending or receiving data.</p>\r\n\t\t</div>"

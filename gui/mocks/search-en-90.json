There are several subspecies\n               but a precise classification of these is still a matter of dispute. The holotypes of the subspecies Eudyptula minor variabilis\n               and Eudyptula minor chathamensis are in the collection of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. The White-flippered\n               Penguin is sometimes considered a subspecies, sometimes a distinct species, and sometimes a morph. As the Australian and Otago\n               (eastern South Island) Little Penguins seem to be a distinct species to which the specific name minor would apply, the White-flippered\n               birds indeed belong to a distinct species, although not exactly as originally assumed. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n             Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA evidence suggests the split between Eudyptula and Spheniscus occurred around 25 million years\n               ago, with the ancestors of the White-flippered and Little Penguins diverging about 2.7 million years ago. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n       \n         \n          Description\n         \n         \n          \n            \t \n            Like those of all penguins, the little penguin's wings have developed into flippers used for swimming. The Little Penguin\n               typically grows to between 30 and 33 cm (12 to 13 inches) tall and usually weighs about 1.5 kilogram on average (3.3 pounds).\n               The head and upperparts are blue in colour, with slate-grey ear coverts fading to white underneath, from the chin to the belly.\n               The flippers are blue. The dark grey-black beak is 3-4 cm long, the irises pale silvery- or bluish-grey or hazel, and the\n               feet pink above with black soles and webbing. An immature individual will have a shorter bill and lighter upperparts. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            Like most seabirds, they have a long lifespan.

The\n               species is not considered endangered, except for the White-Flippered subspecies found only on Banks Peninsula and nearby Motunau\n               Island in New Zealand. Since the 1960s, the mainland population has declined by 60-70%; though there has been a small increase\n               on Motunau Island. But overall Little Penguin populations have been decreasing as well, with some colonies having been wiped\n               out and other populations continuing to be at risk. However, new colonies have been established in urban areas. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            The greatest threat to Little Penguin populations has been predation (including nest predation) from cats, foxes, large reptiles,\n               ferrets and stoats. Due to their diminutive size and the introduction of new predators, some colonies have been reduced in\n               size by as much as 98% in just a few years, such as the small colony on Middle Island, near Warrnambool, Victoria, which was\n               reduced from 5000 penguins to 100. Because of this threat of colony collapse, conservationists pioneered an experimental technique\n               using Maremma Sheepdogs to protect the colony and fend off would-be predators. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n             \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n       \n         \n          Behaviour\n         \n         \n         \n             \n               \t \n               In contrast to the other species, Little Penguins are nocturnal. That means they generally do not enter the shore before dusk\n                  and leave it before dawn. They forage during the day and often will sleep beside the nest at night after they have fed chicks.\n                  This species nests in burrows, under trees, in rock crevices, and sometimes in caves. Usually nests are clustered to form\n                  colonies, but single breeding pairs are not uncommon. At sea Little Penguins are often found alone or in small groups of up\n                  to ten birds, but sometimes these groups can be much larger. Although foraging trip durations can be highly variable, Little\n                  Penguins tend to stay close to the coast. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n             \n            \t \n            \n                Diet \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               These birds feed by hunting fish, squid and other small sea animals, for which they travel and dive quite extensively. They\n                  are generally inshore feeders. The use of data loggers has provided information of the diving behavior of Little Penguins.\n                  50% of their dives go no deeper than 2 m and the mean diving time is 21 seconds. Yet, they are able to dive as deep as 20m\n                  and remained submerged as long as 60 sec. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            \n               Breeding \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               Little penguins dig out (0,5 m) deep burrows for their nest.

The period of egg laying is long\n                  and flexible, between June and October with a peak in September. In good years even two clutches can be raised in one year.\n                  Normally two (sometimes even 3) eggs are laid and mostly both chicks will hatch and fledge. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               Incubation lasts 33 till 39 days, in alternating shifts of 1 à 3 days by both parents. When they hatch, chicks have a brown-grey\n                  down, which is replaced by a chocolate brown down on the back and a light grey down on the front after one week. Chicks are\n                  guarded during 30 days by one parent, while the other one feeds them. Crèches are sometimes made, but only in very small groups\n                  of up to 6 chicks. The chicks moult and fledge in March when they are 50 till 65 days (8 weeks) old. Chicks are fed at night\n                  (nocturnal! ). Little penguins are loyal for live and return every year to the same nest and partner. Although sedentary birds,\n                  some breeding pairs will stay in the neighbouring water from April till August or court ashore.

They stay by the Cromwell Current during the day since it is cooler and return to the\n                  land at night. They eat small schooling fish, mainly mullet, sardines, and sometimes crustaceans. They only go search for\n                  food during the day and normally within a few kilometers of their breeding site. They depend on the cold nutrient-rich currents\n                  to bring them food. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n               The temperature at the islands stays between 15 and 28 degrees Celsius (59-82 °F). During El Niño seasons, the penguins put\n                  off breeding since their food becomes less abundant; this makes the chances of raising offspring successfully unfavorable\n                  compared to the chances of dying in the attempt. They usually breed when the sea surface temperature is below 24 degrees Celsius\n                  (75 °F) which results in more food for them. The strong sun is the main problem for the penguins. Their primary means of cooling\n                  off is going into the water, but they have other behavioral adaptations because of all the time they spend on land. They use\n                  two methods of thermoregulation in warmer weather on land. One is by stretching out their flippers and hunching forward to\n                  keep the sun from shining on their feet, since they can lose heat from their flippers due to the blood flow there. They also\n                  pant, using evaporation to cool the throat and airways. Galapagos penguins protect their eggs and chicks from the hot sun\n                  by keeping them in deep crevices in the rocks. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n               The species is endangered, with an estimated population size of around 1,500 individuals in 2004, according to a survey by\n                  the Charles Darwin Research Station. The population underwent an alarming decline of over 70% in the 1980s, but is slowly\n                  recovering. It is therefore the rarest penguin species (a status which is often falsely attributed to the Yellow-eyed Penguin).\n                  Population levels are influenced by the effects of the El Niño Southern Oscillation, which reduces the availability of shoaling\n                  fish, leading to low reproduction or starvation. However, anthropogenic factors (e.g. oil pollution, fishing by-catch and\n                  competition) may be adding to the ongoing demise of this species. On Isabela Island, introduced cats, dogs and rats attack\n                  penguins and destroy their nests. When in the water, they are preyed upon by sharks, fur seals, and sea lions. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n             \n            \t \n            \n               Breeding \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               There are less than 1000 breeding pairs of Galapagos penguins in the world. Breeding begins when the temperature of the sea\n                  surface falls to around 24°C. Most nests are seen between May and January. The nests are made within 50 metres (160 ft) of\n                  the water on the shore, usually on Fernandina and Isabela Islands. Adults stay near the breeding area during the year with\n                  their mate that they have chosen for life. When the penguins are breeding, incubation takes 38-40 days with both parents helping\n                  out. After thirty days of the chicks being born and both parents sharing responsibility of taking care of them, the chicks\n                  have feathers that are brown above and white below. The purpose of this is to protect the chicks from the strong sun more\n                  so than keeping them warm. The Galapagos penguin mates for life. It lays one or two eggs in places such as caves and crevices,\n                  protected from direct sunlight, which can lead to the eggs overheating. One parent will always stay with the eggs or chicks\n                  while the other is absent for several days to feed. The parents usually only rear up one child. If there is not enough food\n                  available, the nest may be abandoned. Bermudian naturalist Louis L. Mowbray was the first who successfully bred the Galapagos\n                  penguin in captivity \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            \n               Predators \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               Because of the Galapagos penguin's smaller size, it has many predators. On land, the penguins must keep an eye out for crabs,\n                  snakes, owls, and hawks, while in the water they must avoid sharks, fur seals, and sea lions. They face many hazards due to\n                  humans, as well as the hazards of unreliable food resources and volcanic activity. Illegal fishermen interrupt the penguins'\n                  nesting trees, and they are often caught in fishing nets by mistake. Much balance has to take place to ensure that the Galápagos\n                  Penguins do not become extinct. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n   ",

Thick blubber deposits provide insulation, as well, and blood vessels in the flippers and legs have evolved\n                  intricate structures to preserve heat. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               They live on barren islands and during winter congregate on large icebergs of the sub-Antarctic Region and the Antarctic Peninsula;\n                  however, they require solid, snow-free ground for nesting. The chinstrap penguin's primary predator is the leopard seal. The\n                  12-13 million chinstrap penguins have typical lifespan of 15-20 years. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               Chinstrap penguins are considered the most aggressive species of penguin \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            \n               Diet \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               Their diet consists of krill, shrimp, and fish, for which they swim up to 80 km (50 mi) offshore each day.

They prefer slopes,\n                  cliffs and ridges on ice free places. Sometimes they breed together with other Pygoscelis species, but on another level than\n                  the rest. They arrive in the colony to court end September-November. Once pairs are made, the female lays 2 eggs in November-December\n                  which will be incubated by both parents in \"shifts\" of 5 à 10 days. The eggs hatch after 33 till 35 days and the chicks remain\n                  in the nest for another 20 à 30 days, before they gather in crèches. There they stay for some weeks, being fed daily. The\n                  chicks moult to their juvenile plumage and leave the nest in end February-March after 50 à 60 days. After the breeding period\n                  the adult birds leave too to forage at sea and return shortly after to moult in March-April. In the period between May till\n                  September the colony is abandoned and all the birds migrate to sea. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n                \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n   ",

The \n            \t\tNew Zealand Giant Penguin was probably the heaviest, weighing 80 kg or more. Both were found on New Zealand, the former also in the Antarctic farther\n            eastwards. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         Traditionally, most extinct species of penguins, giant or small, had been placed in the paraphyletic subfamily called Palaeeudyptinae.\n            More recently, with new taxa being discovered and placed in the phylogeny if possible, it is becoming accepted that there\n            were at least two major extinct lineages. One or two closely related ones occurred in Patagonia, and at least one other—which\n            is or includes the paleeudyptines as recognized today – occurred on most Antarctic and subantarctic coasts. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         But size plasticity seems to have been great at this initial stage of penguin radiation: on Seymour Island, Antarctica, for\n            example, around 10 known species of penguins ranging in size from medium to huge apparently coexisted some 35 million years\n            ago during the Priabonian (Late Eocene).[24] It is not even known whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a monophyletic\n            lineage, or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a much restricted Palaeeudyptinae and the Anthropornithinae – whether\n            they were considered valid, or whether there was a wide size range present in the Palaeeudyptinae as delimited as usually\n            done these days (i.e., including Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi). The oldest well-described giant penguin, the 5-foot (1.5 m)-tall\n            Icadyptes salasi, actually occurred as far north as northern Peru about 36 million years ago. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         In any case, the gigantic penguins had disappeared by the end of the Paleogene, around 25 million years ago. Their decline\n            and disappearance coincided with the spread of the Squalodontoidea and other primitive, fish-eating toothed whales, which\n            certainly competed with them for food, and were ultimately more successful. A new lineage, the Paraptenodytes, which includes\n            smaller but decidedly stout-legged forms, had already arisen in southernmost South America by that time. The early Neogene\n            saw the emergence of yet another morphotype in the same area, the similarly sized but more gracile Palaeospheniscinae, as\n            well as the radiation that gave rise to the penguin biodiversity of our time. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n         \n         \n            \n            Parent topic: Evolution\n            \n         \n         \n      \n   ",

They exhibit very little sexual dimorphism in size. The\n            necks are able to kink in an S-shape, due to the modified shape of the sixth vertebrae. The neck is able to retract and extend,\n            and is retracted during flight, unlike most other long-necked birds. The legs are long and strong and in almost every species\n            are unfeathered from the lower part of the tibia. In flight the legs and feet are held backward.

It can vary from extremely fine, as in the agami heron, to thick as in the grey\n            heron. The most atypical bill is owned by the boat-billed heron, which has a broad thick bill. The bill, as well as other\n            bare parts of the body, is usually yellow, black or brown coloured, although this colour can vary during the breeding season.\n            The wings are broad and long, exhibiting 10-11 primaries feathers (the boat-billed heron has only nine), 15-20 secondaries\n            and 12 rectrices (10 in the bitterns). The feathers of the herons are soft and the plumage is usually blue, black, brown,\n            grey or white, and can often be strikingly complex. Amongst the day herons there is little sexual dimorphism in plumage (except\n            in the pond-herons); differences between the sexes are the rule for the night herons and smaller bitterns. Many species also\n            have different colour morphs. In the Pacific reef heron there are both dark and light colour morphs, and the percentage of\n            each morph varies geographically.

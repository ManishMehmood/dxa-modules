Most Antarctic\n                  penguin species nest in large high density aggregations of birds. In contrast yellow-eyed penguins do not nest within visual\n                  sight of each other. While they can be seen coming ashore in groups of 4-6 or more individuals then disperse along track to\n                  individual nests sites out of sight of each other. The consensus view of New Zealand penguin workers is that it is preferable\n                  to use habitat rather than colony to refer to areas where yellow-eyed penguins nest.Nest sites are selected in August and\n                  normally two eggs are laid in September. The incubation duties (lasting 39-51 days) are shared by both parents who may spend\n                  several days on the nest at a time. For the first six weeks after hatching, the chicks are guarded during the day by one parent\n                  while the other is at sea feeding. The foraging adult returns at least daily to feed the chicks and relieve the partner. \n                  \t\t\n               </p>\n               \n               \t\t\n               <p class=\"p\">After the chicks are six weeks of age, both parents go to sea to supply food to their rapidly growing offspring. Chicks usually\n                  fledge in mid February and are totally independent from then on. Chick fledge weights are generally between 5 and 6 kg. \n                  \t\t\n               </p>\n               \n               \t\t\n               <p class=\"p\">First breeding occurs at 3-4 years of age and long term partnerships are formed. \n                  \t\t\n               </p>\n               \n               \t \n            </div>\n            \n            \t \n            <div class=\"section\" id=\"TOPIC_A04A079775754639ADCCFF10C36C588A__SECTION_AF6F40591F4D4CA58300DDEE9B24954C\">\n               <h3 class=\"title sectiontitle\">Predators</h3> \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               <p class=\"p\">In the water they are killed by sharks and sea lions. A leopard seal or orca will do so too, but that is rather seldom. On\n                  the mainland they suffer a lot from introduced mammals like cats and dogs. Mustelids (ferrets, weasels, ...) and rats will\n                  rob eggs and small chicks from the nest. Destruction (clearing) of the forests on the coast and grazing cattle have a very\n                  negative influence on their population number too. And on remote islands, the birds have to suffer of the commercial overfishery,\n                  stealing their food. \n                  \t\t\n               </p>\n               \n               \t \n            </div>\n            \n            \n         </div>\n         \n         \n      </div>\n      \n   "

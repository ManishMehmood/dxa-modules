Caves and overhanging cliffs are preferred, while they offer protection against the\n                  weather. Rockhoppers conquer a lot for the best places and aggressive behaviour is normal practice with them. Some colonies\n                  are shared with the larger erect-crested penguins. There is a large time interval between the breeding season of the Northern\n                  subspecies (E.e.moseleyi) and the more southern breeding subspecies (E. c. chrysocome on Falklands etc.).

During incubation (32 till 34 days), the parents alternate with equally long\n                  shifts of 10 days. The males guard and take care for the hatched chick during the first period of 24-26 days, while the female\n                  forages and feeds the chick daily. Then the chicks form small creches and the parents both feed the chick. The chicks moult\n                  to their juvenile plumage and fledge in February (December-January at the northern subspecies) when they are 65 till 75 days\n                  old. The adults moult in April, after a period at sea to eat. For the northern subspecies, this period at sea before moulting\n                  lasts a lot longer (till up to 2 months) than for the southern one. \n                  \t\t\n               </p>\n               \n               \t \n            </div>\n            \n            \n         </div>\n         \n         \n      </div>\n      \n   "

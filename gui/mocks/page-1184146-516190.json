To keep warm, the penguins have four\n                  layers of feathering. King penguins have 70 feathers per every square inch. The outer layer of feathers are oiled and waterproof,\n                  unlike the feathering of a duck, which reduces the amount of water absorbed that would otherwise increase their weight. The\n                  inner three layers are down feathers, very effective insulation. A chick is born without the oily outer layer, and therefore\n                  cannot fish until immaturity. A king penguin chick has dark down feathers. They remain on land and do not go into the water\n                  until their down feathers have fallen off. \n                  \t\t\n               </p>\n               \n               \t \n            </div>\n            \n            \t \n            <div class=\"section\" id=\"TOPIC_0F8AFB391EBE4F03A85EE7D505A74005__SECTION_7C962F585E3C4982B2A3F2D5206B1D92\">\n               <h3 class=\"title sectiontitle\"> Drinking</h3> \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               <p class=\"p\">Like most penguins, king penguins are able to drink salt water because of their supraorbital glands which filter excess salt\n                  from their blood stream by way of a capillary just above the eyes.

The current maximum dive recorded is 343 metres in the Falkland Islands region, and a maximum time submerged\n                  of 552 seconds recorded at the Crozet Islands. The king penguin dives to depths of 100-300 meters (350-1000 feet), spending\n                  around 5 minutes submerged, during daylight hours, and less than 30 metres (98 ft) at night. \n                  \t \n               </p>\n               \n               \t \n               <p class=\"p\">The majority (around 88% in one study) of dives undertaken by king penguins are flat-bottomed; that is, the penguin dives\n                  to a certain depth and remains there for a period of time hunting (roughly 50% of total dive time) before returning to the\n                  surface. They have been described as U-shaped or W-shaped, relating to the course of the dive. The bird dives in a V-shaped\n                  or 'spike' pattern in the remaining 12% of dives; that is the bird dives at an angle through the water column, reaches a certain\n                  depth and then returns to the surface. Other penguins dive in this latter foraging pattern in contrast. Observations at Crozet\n                  Islands revealed most King penguins were seen within 30 km (19 mi) of the colony. Using the average swimming speed, Kooyman\n                  estimated the distance travelled to foraging areas at 28 km (17 mi). \n                  \t \n               </p>\n               \n               \t \n               <p class=\"p\">Its average swimming speed is 6.5-10 km/h (4-6 mph).

King penguins are serially monogamous. They have only\n                  one mate each year, and stay faithful to that mate. However, fidelity between years is only about 29%. The long breeding cycle\n                  may contribute to this low rate. \n                  \t\t\n               </p>\n               \n               \t\t\n               <p class=\"p\">The king penguin has an unusually prolonged breeding cycle, taking some 14-16 months from laying to offspring fledging. Although\n                  pairs will attempt to breed annually, they are generally only successful one year in two, or two years in three in a triennial\n                  pattern on South Georgia. The reproductive cycle begins in September to November, as birds return to colonies for a prenuptial\n                  moult. Those that were unsuccessful in breeding the previous season will often arrive earlier. They then return to the sea\n                  for three weeks before coming ashore in November or December. \n                  \t\t\n               </p>\n               \n               \t\t\n               <div class=\"fig fignone\" id=\"TOPIC_115EF7F02D30412292A3094E874D99AD__FIG_FE4784E57A8E4C1B8DAA0BD5FBE64D67\"><img class=\"image\" id=\"TOPIC_115EF7F02D30412292A3094E874D99AD__IMAGE_67C4311393B34686B642DD37FED5FF64\" width=\"172\" height=\"188\" src=\"/app/gui/mocks/bin/1184146-515105-16.jpg\" /> \n                  \t\t\n               </div>\n               \n               \t\t\n               <p class=\"p\"> The female penguin lays one pyriform (pear-shaped) white egg weighing 300 g (⅔ lb). It is initially soft, but hardens and\n                  darkens to a pale greenish colour. It measures around 10 cm × 7 cm (3.9 in × 2.8 in). The egg is incubated for around 55 days\n                  with both birds sharing incubation in shifts of 6-18 days each. Hatching may take up to 2-3 days to complete, and chicks are\n                  born semi-altricial and nidicolous. In other words, they have only a thin covering of down and are entirely dependent on their\n                  parents for food and warmth. The guard phase starts with the birth of the chick. The young chick is spends its time balanced\n                  on its parents' feet and is sheltered by its pouch (abdominal skin). During this time, the parents alternate every 3-7 days,\n                  one guarding the chick while the other forages. The guard phase lasts for 30-40 days. By then the chick has grown much bigger,\n                  can keep itself warm and protect itself against most predators. It becomes more curious and starts to explore its surroundings.\n                  It ends up forming a group with other chicks, a so-called crèche. Crèches are guarded by only a few adult birds; most parents\n                  can leave their chick to forage for themselves and their chick. Other species of penguins also practice this method of communal\n                  care for offspring. \n                  \t\t\n               </p>\n               \n               \t\t\n               <p class=\"p\">By April the chicks are almost fully grown, but lose weight by fasting over the winter months, gaining it again during spring\n                  in September.

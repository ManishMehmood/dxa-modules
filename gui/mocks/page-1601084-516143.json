While they were not as well-adapted to aquatic life as modern penguins, Waimanu were generally\n            loon-like birds but already flightless, with short wings adapted for deep diving. They swam on the surface using mainly their\n            feet, but the wings were – as opposed to most other diving birds, living and extinct – already adapting to underwater locomotion.\n            \n            \t \n         </p>\n         \n         \t \n         <p class=\"p\">Perudyptes from northern Peru was dated to 42 million years ago. An unnamed fossil from Argentina proves that by the Bartonian\n            (Middle Eocene), some 39–38 million years ago, primitive penguins had spread to South America and were in the process of expanding\n            into Atlantic waters. \n            \t \n         </p>\n         \n         \t \n         <p class=\"p\"><img class=\"image\" id=\"GUID-11DA809B-B781-4394-9F2B-43170E586CDB__IMAGE_A043C5719D2A428BA203341F48A125AF\" src=\"/app/gui/mocks/bin/1601084-514972-16.jpg\" /> \n            \t \n         </p>\n         \n         \n      </div>\n      \n      \n      <div class=\"related-links\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n         \n         <div class=\"familylinks\">\n            \n            <div class=\"parentlink\"><strong>Parent topic:</strong> <a class=\"link\" href=\"/app/1601084/516982/penguin-guide/evolution\">Evolution</a></div>\n            \n         </div>\n         \n      </div>\n   "

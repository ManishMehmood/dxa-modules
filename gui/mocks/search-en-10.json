Take this into account when\n            performing other operations with your phone.\n         \n         \n         \n         There may be restrictions on using devices using Bluetooth technology. Check with your local authorities.\n         \n         \n         When you receive data via Bluetooth, a tone sound is played and you are asked if you want to accept the message. If you accept,\n            the item is placed in the Inbox folder in Messaging.\n         \n         \n         \n         A Bluetooth connection is disconnected automatically after sending or receiving data.\n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n         \n         \n            \n            Parent topic: Your phone\n            \n         \n         \n      \n   ",

During courtship, they keep awake the inhabitants (nocturnal on land)\n               by their calls and fights. And while feeding their chicks, some fish remains will cause a foul smell.

The general Faroese term for skuas is kjógvi [ˈtʃɛkvə]. The word \"jaeger\" is derived from the\n               German word Jäger, meaning \"hunter\". \n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n            Skuas nest on the ground in temperate and Arctic regions, and are long-distance migrants.

Many are partial kleptoparasites, comprising up to 95% of\n               the feeding methods of wintering birds, by chasing gulls, terns and other seabirds to steal their catches, regardless of the\n               size of the species attacked (up to 3 times heavier than the attacking skua). The larger species, such as the great skua,\n               also regularly kill and eat adult birds, such as puffins and gulls, and have been recorded as killing birds as large as a\n               grey heron. On the breeding grounds, the three, more slender Northern breeding species commonly eat lemmings. Those species\n               that breed in the Southern Oceans, largely feed on fish that can be caught near their colonies. The eggs and young of other\n               birds are an important food source for most skua species during the nesting season. In the Southern oceans and Antarctica\n               region, some skua species (especially the South Polar skua) will readily scavenge the carcasses at breeding colonies of penguins\n               and pinnipeds, sometimes taking live penguin chicks. In these areas, skuas seem to defer to the considerably larger giant\n               petrels. \n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n            They are medium to large birds, typically with grey or brown plumage, often with white markings on the wings. The skuas range\n               in size from the long-tailed skua, \n               \t\t  Stercorarius longicauda, at 310 grams (11 oz), to the brown skua, \n               \t\t  Stercorarius antarcticus, at 1.63 kg (3.6 lb). On average, a skua is about 56 cm (22 in) long, and 121 cm (48 in) across the wings. They have longish\n               bills with a hooked tip, and webbed feet with sharp claws. They look like large dark gulls, but have a fleshy cere above the\n               upper mandible. The skuas are strong, acrobatic fliers. They are generally aggressive in disposition. Potential predators\n               who go near their nest will be quickly dived at by the parent bird, which usually targets the head of the intruder - a practice\n               known as 'dive bombing' \n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n         \n         \n            \n            South polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki)\n               \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n         \n            \n            Parent topic: Other birds\n            \n         \n         \n      \n   ",

Some seminal articles about penguin prehistory have been published since 2005, the\n            evolution of the living genera can be considered resolved by now. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         The basal penguins lived around the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event somewhere in the general area of (southern)\n            New Zealand and Byrd Land, Antarctica. Due to plate tectonics, these areas were at that time less than 1,500 kilometres (930\n            mi) apart rather than the 4,000 kilometres (2,500 mi) of today. The most recent common ancestor of penguins and their sister\n            clade can be roughly dated to the Campanian–Maastrichtian boundary, around 70–68 million years ago. What can be said as certainly\n            as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that by the end of the Cretaceous, the penguin lineage must\n            have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so morphologically; it is fairly likely that they were not yet entirely\n            flightless at that time, as flightless birds have generally low resilience to the breakdown of trophic webs that follows the\n            initial phase of mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities (see also Flightless Cormorant). \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n         \n         \n            \n            Basal fossils\n               \n            \n            \n            Palaeeudyptines\n               \n            \n            \n            Origin and systematics of modern penguins\n               \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n         \n            \n            Parent topic: Systematics and evolution\n            \n         \n         \n      \n   ",

There are four living species of penguins known\n               as banded penguins, and all have similar coloration. They are sometimes also known as \"Jack-ass penguins\" due to their loud\n               locator calls sounding similar to a donkey braying. Common traits include a band of black that runs around their bodies bordering\n               their black dorsal coloring, black beaks with a small vertical white band, distinct spots on their bellies, and a small patch\n               of unfeathered or thinly feathered skin around their eyes that can be either white or pink.

The first scientific description was made in 1781 by Johann Reinhold Forster on the basis of Falkland Islands. They call\n               in a variety of ways, but the most frequently heard is a loud trumpeting which is emitted with its head thrown back. \n               \n            \n            \n            \n            The application of Gentoo to the penguin is unclear. The Oxford English Dictionary notes that Gentoo used to be an Anglo-Indian\n               term used as early as 1638 to distinguish Hindus in India from Muslims. The English term originated from the Portuguese gentio\n               (compare \"gentile\"); in the 20th century the term came to be regarded as derogatory. \n               \n            \n            \n            \n             \n               \n            \n            \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n         \n         \n            \n            Parent topic: Pygoscelis (Brush-tailed penguins)\n            \n         \n         \n      \n       \n         \n          Taxonomy\n         \n         \n          \n            \t \n            The Gentoo penguin is one of three species in the genus \n               \t\tPygoscelis. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA evidence suggests the genus split from other penguins around 38 million years ago, about 2\n               million years after the ancestors of the genus Aptenodytes. In turn, the Adelie Penguins split off from the other members\n               of the genus around 19 million years ago, and the Chinstrap and Gentoo finally diverging around 14 million years ago. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            Two sub-species of this penguin are recognised: \n               \t\tPygoscelis papua papua and the smaller \n               \t\tPygoscelis papua ellsworthii' \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n       \n         \n         Description\n         \n         \n          \n             \n               \t \n               The Gentoo penguin is easily recognized by the wide white stripe extending like a bonnet across the top of its head and its\n                  bright orange-red bill. They have pale whitish-pink webbed feet and a fairly long tail - the most prominent tail of all penguins.\n                  Chicks have grey backs with white fronts. As the Gentoo penguin waddles along on land, its tail sticks out behind, sweeping\n                  from side to side, hence the scientific name Pygoscelis, which means \"rump-tailed\". \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n               Adult Gentoos reach a height of 51 to 90 cm (20-36 in), making them the third largest species of penguin after the two giant\n                  species, the \n                  \t\tEmperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) and the \n                  \t\tKing penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus). Males have a maximum weight of about 8.5 kg (19 lb) just before molting, and a minimum weight of about 4.9 kg (10.8 lb)\n                  just before mating. For females the maximum weight is 8.2 kg (18 lb) just before moulting, but their weight drops to as little\n                  as 4.5 kg (10 lb) when guarding the chicks in the nest. Birds from the north are on average 700 g (1.5 lb) heavier and 10\n                  cm (4 in) taller than the southern birds. Southern Gentoo penguins reach 75-80 cm (30-31 in) in length. They are the fastest\n                  underwater swimming penguins, reaching speeds of 36 km/h. Gentoo are adapted to very harsh cold climates. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n                \n                  \t \n               \n               \n             \n            \t \n            \n               Identification \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               Gentoo penguins are characterised by a white patch around and behind the eye that joins on the crown.

Two subspecies are recognised: a larger form in the sub-Antarctic and a smaller, but\n                  otherwise similar subspecies on the Antarctic Peninsula. Juveniles are very similar to adults, but the white eye-patch is\n                  not connected to their white eye-rings until they moult at an age of 14 months. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n       \n         \n         Distribution and habitat\n         \n         \n          \n             \n               \t \n                Mainly in the sub-Antarctic, but extending to the Antarctic Peninsula.

In Georgia,\n               for example, breeding colonies are two kilometers inland. Whereas in colonies farther inland, where the penguins nest between\n               tufts of grass, they shift location slightly every year because the grass may get trampled over time. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n             \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            Gentoos breed on many sub-Antarctic islands.

The\n               total breeding population is estimated to be over 300,000 pairs. Nests are usually made from a roughly circular pile of stones\n               and can be quite large, 20 cm high and 25 cm in diameter. The stones are jealously guarded and their ownership can be the\n               subject of noisy disputes between individual penguins.

This genus\n            has a distribution centered on the Antarctic coasts and barely extends to some subantarctic islands today.\n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         Pygoscelis contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head pattern; their distribution is intermediate, centered\n            on Antarctic coasts but extending somewhat northwards from there. In external morphology, these apparently still resemble\n            the common ancestor of the Spheniscinae, as Aptenodytes' autapomorphies are in most cases fairly pronounced adaptations related\n            to that genus' extreme habitat conditions. As the former genus, Pygoscelis seems to have diverged during the Bartonian, but\n            the range expansion and radiation that led to the present-day diversity probably did not occur until much later; around the\n            Burdigalian stage of the Early Miocene, roughly 20–15 million years ago.\n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         The genera Spheniscus and Eudyptula contain species with a mostly subantarctic distribution centered on South America; some,\n            however, range quite far northwards. They all lack carotenoid coloration, and the former genus has a conspicuous banded head\n            pattern; they are unique among living penguins by nesting in burrows. This group probably radiated eastwards with the Antarctic\n            Circumpolar Current out of the ancestral range of modern penguins throughout the Chattian (Late Oligocene), starting approximately\n            28 million years ago. While the two genera separated during this time, the present-day diversity is the result of a Pliocene\n            radiation, taking place some 4–2 million years ago.\n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         The Megadyptes–Eudyptes clade occurs at similar latitudes (though not as far north as the Galapagos Penguin), has its highest\n            diversity in the New Zealand region, and represent a westward dispersal. They are characterized by hairy yellow ornamental\n            head feathers; their bills are at least partly red. These two genera diverged apparently in the Middle Miocene (Langhian,\n            roughly 15–14 million years ago), but again, the living species of Eudyptes are the product of a later radiation, stretching\n            from about the late Tortonian (Late Miocene, 8 million years ago) to the end of the Pliocene.\n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         The geographical and temporal pattern or spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of global cooling documented\n            in the paleoclimatic record. The emergence of the subantarctic lineage at the end of the Bartonian corresponds with the onset\n            of the slow period of cooling that eventually led to the ice ages some 35 million years later. With habitat on the Antarctic\n            coasts declining, by the Priabonian more hospitable conditions for most penguins existed in the subantarctic regions rather\n            than in Antarctica itself. Notably, the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current also started as a continuous circumpolar flow only\n            around 30 million years ago, on the one hand forcing the Antarctic cooling, and on the other facilitating the eastward expansion\n            of Spheniscus to South America and eventually beyond. Despite this, there is no fossil evidence to support the idea of a crown\n            radiation from the antarctic continent in the Paleogene.\n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         Later, an interspersed period of slight warming was ended by the Middle Miocene Climate Transition, a sharp drop in global\n            average temperature from 14–12 million years ago, and similar abrupt cooling events followed at 8 million years ago and 4\n            million years ago; by the end of the Tortonian, the Antarctic ice sheet was already much like today in volume and extent.\n            The emergence of most of today's subantarctic penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of Neogene climate\n            shifts.\n            \t \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n         \n         \n            \n            Parent topic: Evolution\n            \n         \n         \n      \n   ",

The male and female are similar in\n                     plumage and size, reaching 122 cm (48 in) in height and weighing anywhere from 22 to 45 kg (49 to 99 lb). The dorsal side\n                     and head are black and sharply delineated from the white belly, pale-yellow breast and bright-yellow ear patches. Like all\n                     penguins it is flightless, with a streamlined body, and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for a marine habitat.\n                     \n                     \t \n                  \n                  \n                  \t \n                  Its diet consists primarily of fish, but can also include crustaceans, such as krill, and cephalopods, such as squid. In hunting,\n                     the species can remain submerged up to 18 minutes, diving to a depth of 535 m (1,755 ft). It has several adaptations to facilitate\n                     this, including an unusually structured hemoglobin to allow it to function at low oxygen levels, solid bones to reduce barotrauma,\n                     and the ability to reduce its metabolism and shut down non-essential organ functions. \n                     \t \n                  \n                  \n                  \t \n                  The Emperor Penguin is perhaps best known for the sequence of journeys adults make each year in order to mate and to feed\n                     their offspring. The only penguin species that breeds during the Antarctic winter, it treks 50–120 km (31–75 mi) over the\n                     ice to breeding colonies which may include thousands of individuals. The female lays a single egg, which is incubated by the\n                     male while the female returns to the sea to feed; parents subsequently take turns foraging at sea and caring for their chick\n                     in the colony. The lifespan is typically 20 years in the wild, although observations suggest that some individuals may live\n                     to 50 years of age. \n                     \t \n                  \n                  \n                  \t \n                   \n                     \t\t\n                      \n                        \t\t\n                     \n                     \n                     \t \n                  \n                  \n                  \n               \n               \n               \n            \n            \n         \n         \n          \n            \n            Pygoscelis – Brush-tailed penguins \n            \n            \n             \n               \n               Adélie Penguin, Pygoscelis adeliae \n                  \n               \n               \n               \n                \n                  \t \n                  The \n                     \t\tAdélie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) is a species of penguin common along the entire Antarctic coast.

One of six species of crested penguin, it\n                     is very closely related to the Royal Penguin, and some authorities consider the two to be a single species. It bears a distinctive\n                     yellow crest, and the face and upperparts are black and sharply delineated from the white underparts. Adults weigh on average\n                     5.5 kg (12 lb) and are 70 cm (28 in) in length. The male and female are similar in appearance although the male is slightly\n                     larger with a relatively larger bill. Like all penguins, it is flightless, with a streamlined body and wings stiffened and\n                     flattened into flippers for a marine lifestyle. \n                     \t \n                  \n                  \n                  \t \n                  Its diet consists of a variety of crustaceans, mainly krill, as well as small fish and cephalopods; the species consumes more\n                     marine life annually than any other species of seabird. These birds moult once a year, spending about three to four weeks\n                     ashore, before returning to the sea. Numbering up to 100,000 individuals, the breeding colonies of the Macaroni Penguin are\n                     among the largest and densest of all penguin species. After spending the summer months breeding, penguins disperse into the\n                     oceans for six months; a 2009 study found that Macaroni Penguins from Kerguelen travelled over 10,000 km (6,200 mi) in the\n                     central Indian Ocean. With about 18 million individuals, the Macaroni Penguin is the most numerous penguin species. However,\n                     widespread declines in populations have been recorded since the mid-1970s. These factors resulted in their conservation status\n                     being reclassified as vulnerable. \n                     \t \n                  \n                  \n                  \t \n                   \n                     \t \n                  \n                  \n                  \n               \n               \n               \n            \n            \n            \n             \n               \n               Chatham Penguin, Eudyptes chathamensis (extinct) \n                  \n               \n               \n               \n                \n                  \t \n                  The Chatham Penguin (Eudyptes chathamensis) was a species of penguin, now extinct.

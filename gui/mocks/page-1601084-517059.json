Cherry-Garrard noted: \"They are extraordinarily like children, these little people of the Antarctic world, either like children\n                  or like old men, full of their own importance.\"Certain displays of their selfishness were commented upon by George Murray\n                  Levick, a Royal Navy Surgeon-Lieutenant and scientist who also accompanied Scott on his ill-fated British Antarctic Expedition\n                  1910, during his surveying of penguins in the Antarctic: \"At the place where they most often went in [the water], a long terrace\n                  of ice about six feet in height ran for some hundreds of yards along the edge of the water, and here, just as on the sea-ice,\n                  crowds would stand near the brink. When they had succeeded in pushing one of their number over, all would crane their necks\n                  over the edge, and when they saw the pioneer safe in the water, the rest followed.\" \n                  \t \n               </p>\n               \n            </div> \n            \t \n            <div class=\"section\" id=\"TOPIC_2CC5FE6D891540D4AC1C43F8725D67D3__SECTION_1326258425AD460F87CA5695E51D22D6\">\n               <h3 class=\"title sectiontitle\">Diet</h3> \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               <p class=\"p\">Adélies feed almost exclusively on krill (99 % of their diet). Most of the time they forage on a depth between 10 till 40\n                  metres, although their record is much deeper. They dive for fish during the daytime, when the light is the most bright under\n                  water. When feeding chicks, they stay close to the colony and return daily to the nest. After breeding they migrate far away\n                  from the colony and stay away for weeks. \n                  \t\t\n               </p>\n               \n               \t \n            </div>\n            \n            \t \n            <div class=\"section\" id=\"TOPIC_2CC5FE6D891540D4AC1C43F8725D67D3__SECTION_27A70BD9B6784D09886D7B8C53F775DE\">\n               <h3 class=\"title sectiontitle\">Breeding</h3> \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               <p class=\"p\">Adélie penguins build a rough nest of stones. They start breeding when they are between 3 till 8 years old. The males arrive\n                  in the colony in the first half of October, after walking tens (30-100) of kilometres over the pack ice. They nest close to\n                  each other between rocks, on hills and ridges in large colonies of up to thousands of pairs. As soon as they found a suitable\n                  nesting place, they start calling out loud to attract a female, with their bill up to the air and their flippers wide open.\n                  When a female reacts, they call together and bow for each other several times. Then mating follows. End October-early November\n                  (6 till 10 days after female arrival), she lays two eggs, which will alternately be incubated by both parents during 32 till\n                  34 days (in shifts of max 12 days). \n                  \t\t\n               </p>\n               \n               \t\t\n               <p class=\"p\">After hatching, the chicks stay 22 days in the nest, where they are (also alternately) be guarded and fed by one parent or\n                  the other, till they are ready to congregate in crèches. Such crèche isn't large and mostly includes 10-20 chicks. The chicks\n                  are almost daily fed. They moult to their juvenile plumage and fledge end January to early February when they are 50 à 60\n                  days old. In the meanwhile it is summer on Antarctica and the pack ice is broken, so the chicks haven't to walk that far to\n                  open sea. Often you can see a chick with a little of down, standing on a floating iceberg or ice floe, while the chicks often\n                  leave before moulting is completed. When the breeding period is over, the adult birds leave for a forage trip at sea for about\n                  ten days, before returning mid March to moult themselves. The moulting period lasts around 20 days. Early April the colony\n                  is completely abandoned till early October a new breeding season begins. Many pairs are loyal for live and return each year\n                  to their same old nest. \n                  \t\t\n               </p>\n               \n               \t\t\n               <p class=\"p\">Adélie penguins arrive at their breeding grounds in October or November, at the end of winter and the start of spring. Their\n                  nests consist of stones piled together. In December, the warmest month in Antarctica (about −2 °C or 28 °F), the parents take\n                  turns incubating the egg; one goes to feed and the other stays to warm the egg. The parent who is incubating does not eat.\n                  In March, the adults and their young return to the sea. The Adélie penguin lives on sea ice but needs the ice-free land to\n                  breed. With a reduction in sea ice and a scarcity of food, populations of the Adélie penguin have dropped by 65% over the\n                  past 25 years. \n                  \t\t\n               </p>\n               \n               \t\t\n               <div class=\"fig fignone\" id=\"TOPIC_2CC5FE6D891540D4AC1C43F8725D67D3__FIG_7CF257DD310B429299C58C7D907F9D20\"><img class=\"image\" id=\"TOPIC_2CC5FE6D891540D4AC1C43F8725D67D3__IMAGE_ED708C34D2124A248F3F7199651910D0\" height=\"599\" width=\"489\" src=\"/app/gui/mocks/bin/1601084-515248-16.jpg\" /> \n                  \t\t\n               </div>\n               \n               \t\t\n               <p class=\"p\">\n                  \t\t\n               </p>\n               \n               \t \n            </div>\n            \n            \t \n            <div class=\"section\" id=\"TOPIC_2CC5FE6D891540D4AC1C43F8725D67D3__SECTION_2463FAE9E84345F19D841467B668B96B\">\n               <h3 class=\"title sectiontitle\">Predators</h3> \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               <p class=\"p\">Adélie penguins are preyed on by leopard seals, \n                  \t\t  <a class=\"xref\" href=\"/1601084/515761/penguin-publication/skuas\">Skuas</a>, and occasionally, orcas. \n                  \t\t\n               </p>\n               \n               \t \n            </div>\n            \n            \n         </div>\n         \n         \n      </div>\n      \n   "

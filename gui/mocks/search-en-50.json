Members of the family Hydrobatidae are increasingly called \n               \t\t   storm petrels; those of the Pelecanoididae are usually called \n               \t\t   diving petrels. \n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n            Among the procellariid petrels, some two dozen species of the genera Pterodroma and Bulweria are called \n               \t\t   gadfly petrels because their flight is more fluttering than that of the related shearwaters (see \n               \t\t   shearwater). Certain heavy-bodied petrels are known as \n               \t\t   fulmars, and one, Macronectes giganteus, is called both giant fulmar and giant petrel (see fulmar). \n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n            Gadfly petrels nest in loose colonies on islands in the tropical and subtropical regions of the major oceans. A single egg\n               (rarely two) is laid on the soil surface or in a burrow or crevice. The chick is tended by both parents and deserted about\n               a week before it is fully fledged; it completes its development on stored fat. During the non-breeding season, these birds\n               roam the open ocean, feeding on squid and small fish. Most gadfly petrels are dark above and light beneath, with long wings\n               and short, wedge-shaped tails. Because they are quite similar in appearance, the species are difficult to distinguish. \n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n            Some of the better known gadfly petrels are the endangered Bermuda petrel, or \n               \t\t   cahow (Pterodroma cahow, sometimes considered a race of P. hasitata); the dark-rumped petrel, also called the Hawaiian petrel (P.\n               phaeopygia), another endangered species, now concentrated almost entirely on the island of Maui; the phoenix petrel (P. alba),\n               which breeds on several tropical archipelagos; and the black-capped petrel, or diablotin (P. hasitata), formerly found throughout\n               the West Indies but now known only in Haiti. Several other species, including the Chatham Island (or magenta) petrel, the\n               Galápagos dark-rumped petrel, and the Réunion petrel, are also on the endangered list. \n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n            Several other procellariids are also called petrels.

The latter tend\n            to be confounded by the strong adaptive autapomorphies of the Sphenisciformes; a sometimes perceived fairly close relationship\n            between penguins and grebes is almost certainly an error based on both groups' strong diving adaptations, which are homoplasies.\n            On the other hand, different DNA sequence datasets do not agree in detail with each other either. \n         \n         \n         \t\t\n         What seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of Neoaves (living birds except paleognaths and fowl) that comprises what\n            is sometimes called \"higher waterbirds\" to distinguish them from the more ancient waterfowl. This group contains such birds\n            as storks, rails, and the seabirds, with the possible exception of the Charadriiformes. \n         \n         \n         \t\t\n         Inside this group, penguin relationships are far less clear. Depending on the analysis and dataset, a close relationship to\n            Ciconiiformes or to Procellariiformes has been suggested. Some think the penguin-like plotopterids (usually considered relatives of anhingas and cormorants) may actually be a sister group of the penguins, and that penguins\n            may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the Pelecaniformes and consequently would have to be included in that order,\n            or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting\n            the traditional Pelecaniformes in three. \n         \n         \n         \t\t\n         Enter an example that illustrates the current task (optional).\n         \n         \t\n      \n      \n      \n      \n         \n         \n            \n            Parent topic: Systematics and evolution\n            \n         \n         \n      \n   ",

Cherry-Garrard noted: \"They are extraordinarily like children, these little people of the Antarctic world, either like children\n                  or like old men, full of their own importance.\"Certain displays of their selfishness were commented upon by George Murray\n                  Levick, a Royal Navy Surgeon-Lieutenant and scientist who also accompanied Scott on his ill-fated British Antarctic Expedition\n                  1910, during his surveying of penguins in the Antarctic: \"At the place where they most often went in [the water], a long terrace\n                  of ice about six feet in height ran for some hundreds of yards along the edge of the water, and here, just as on the sea-ice,\n                  crowds would stand near the brink. When they had succeeded in pushing one of their number over, all would crane their necks\n                  over the edge, and when they saw the pioneer safe in the water, the rest followed.\" \n                  \t \n               \n               \n             \n            \t \n            \n               Diet \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               Adélies feed almost exclusively on krill (99 % of their diet). Most of the time they forage on a depth between 10 till 40\n                  metres, although their record is much deeper. They dive for fish during the daytime, when the light is the most bright under\n                  water. When feeding chicks, they stay close to the colony and return daily to the nest. After breeding they migrate far away\n                  from the colony and stay away for weeks. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            \n               Breeding \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               Adélie penguins build a rough nest of stones. They start breeding when they are between 3 till 8 years old. The males arrive\n                  in the colony in the first half of October, after walking tens (30-100) of kilometres over the pack ice. They nest close to\n                  each other between rocks, on hills and ridges in large colonies of up to thousands of pairs. As soon as they found a suitable\n                  nesting place, they start calling out loud to attract a female, with their bill up to the air and their flippers wide open.\n                  When a female reacts, they call together and bow for each other several times. Then mating follows. End October-early November\n                  (6 till 10 days after female arrival), she lays two eggs, which will alternately be incubated by both parents during 32 till\n                  34 days (in shifts of max 12 days). \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               After hatching, the chicks stay 22 days in the nest, where they are (also alternately) be guarded and fed by one parent or\n                  the other, till they are ready to congregate in crèches. Such crèche isn't large and mostly includes 10-20 chicks. The chicks\n                  are almost daily fed. They moult to their juvenile plumage and fledge end January to early February when they are 50 à 60\n                  days old. In the meanwhile it is summer on Antarctica and the pack ice is broken, so the chicks haven't to walk that far to\n                  open sea. Often you can see a chick with a little of down, standing on a floating iceberg or ice floe, while the chicks often\n                  leave before moulting is completed. When the breeding period is over, the adult birds leave for a forage trip at sea for about\n                  ten days, before returning mid March to moult themselves. The moulting period lasts around 20 days. Early April the colony\n                  is completely abandoned till early October a new breeding season begins. Many pairs are loyal for live and return each year\n                  to their same old nest. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               Adélie penguins arrive at their breeding grounds in October or November, at the end of winter and the start of spring. Their\n                  nests consist of stones piled together. In December, the warmest month in Antarctica (about −2 °C or 28 °F), the parents take\n                  turns incubating the egg; one goes to feed and the other stays to warm the egg. The parent who is incubating does not eat.\n                  In March, the adults and their young return to the sea. The Adélie penguin lives on sea ice but needs the ice-free land to\n                  breed. With a reduction in sea ice and a scarcity of food, populations of the Adélie penguin have dropped by 65% over the\n                  past 25 years. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n                \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            \n               Predators \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               Adélie penguins are preyed on by leopard seals, \n                  \t\t  Skuas, and occasionally, orcas. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n   ",

Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark\n            and white plumage, and their wings have evolved into flippers. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid, and other forms of\n            sealife caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their lives on land and half in the oceans. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as Antarctica.\n            In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the temperate zone, and one species,\n            the Galápagos Penguin, lives near the equator. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         The largest living species is the Emperor Penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri): on average adults are about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall\n            and weigh 35 kg (75 lb) or more. The smallest penguin species is the Little Blue Penguin (Eudyptula minor), also known as\n            the Fairy Penguin, which stands around 40 cm tall (16 in) and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins, larger penguins\n            inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates (see also Bergmann's\n            Rule). Some prehistoric species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human. These were not restricted\n            to Antarctic regions; on the contrary, subantarctic regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred\n            in a region not quite 2,000 km south of the equator 35 mya, in a climate decidedly warmer than today. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n         \n         \n            \n            Parent topic: Penguins Overview\n            \n         \n         \n      \n   ",

Both male and female parents take shifts incubating eggs and young. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            Crested penguins lay two eggs but almost always raise only one young successfully. All species exhibit the odd phenomenon\n               of \n               \t\tegg-size dimorphism in breeding; the first egg (or A-egg) laid is substantially smaller than the second egg (B-egg). This is most extreme in\n               the Macaroni Penguin, where the first egg averages only 60% the size of the second. The reason for this is a mystery, although\n               several theories have been proposed, remains unknown. British ornithologist David Lack theorized the genus was evolving toward\n               the laying of a one-egg clutch. Experiments with egg substitution have shown that A-eggs can produce viable chicks which were\n               only 7% lighter at time of fledging. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            Recently, brooding Royal and Erect-crested Penguins have been reported to tip the smaller eggs out as the second is laid.\n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n       \n         \n         Species\n         \n         \n          \n            \t \n            \n            \n               \n                  \n                     \n                     \n                     \n                     \n                  \n                   \n                     \t\t\t \n                      \n                        \t\t\t\t\n                        Common and binomial names \n                           \t\t\t\t\n                        \n                        \n                        \t\t\t\t\n                        Image \n                           \t\t\t\t\n                        \n                        \n                        \t\t\t\t\n                        Description \n                           \t\t\t\t\n                        \n                        \n                        \t\t\t\t\n                        Range \n                           \t\t\t\t\n                        \n                        \n                        \t\t\t \n                     \n                     \n                     \t\t  \n                  \n                  \n                   \n                     \t\t\t \n                      \n                        \t\t\t\t\n                        Fiordland Penguin (Eudyptes pachyrhynchus) \n                           \t\t\t\t\n                        \n                        \n                        \t\t\t\t\n                         \n                           \t\t\t\t\n                        \n                        \n                        \t\t\t\t\n                        Medium-sized, yellow-crested, black-and-white penguins, growing to approximately 60 cm (24 in) long and weighing on average\n                           3.7 kg (8.2 lbs), with a weight range of 2 to 5.95 kg (4.4 to 13.1 lb).

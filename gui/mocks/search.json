There are fifteen species of crane in four genera. Unlike the similar-looking\n            but unrelated herons, cranes fly with necks outstretched, not pulled back. Cranes live on all continents except Antarctica\n            and South America. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         They are opportunistic feeders that change their diet according to the season and their own nutrient requirements. They eat\n            a range of items from suitably sized small rodents, fish, amphibians, and insects, to grain, berries, and plants. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         Cranes construct platform nests in shallow water, and typically lay two eggs at a time. Both parents help to rear the young,\n            which remain with them until the next breeding season. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         Some species and populations of cranes migrate over long distances; others do not migrate at all. Cranes are solitary during\n            the breeding season, occurring in pairs, but during the non-breeding season they are gregarious, forming large flocks where\n            their numbers are sufficient. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n          \n            \t\t\n            \n                \n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n         \n         \n            \n            Parent topic: Other birds\n            \n         \n         \n      \n   ",

One of six species of crested penguin, it\n               is very closely related to the \n               Royal Penguin (Eudyptes schlegeli), and some authorities consider the two to be a single species. It bears a distinctive yellow crest, and the face and upper\n               parts are black and sharply delineated from the white underparts. Adults weigh on average 5.5 kg (12 lb) and are 70 cm (28\n               in) in length. The male and female are similar in appearance although the male is slightly larger with a relatively larger\n               bill. Like all penguins, it is flightless, with a streamlined body and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for a marine\n               lifestyle. \n               \n            \n            \n            \n            Its diet consists of a variety of crustaceans, mainly krill, as well as small fish and cephalopods; the species consumes more\n               marine life annually than any other species of seabird. These birds moult once a year, spending about three to four weeks\n               ashore, before returning to the sea. Numbering up to 100,000 individuals, the breeding colonies of the Macaroni penguin are\n               among the largest and densest of all penguin species. After spending the summer months breeding, penguins disperse into the\n               oceans for six months; a 2009 study found that Macaroni penguins from Kerguelen travelled over 10,000 km (6,200 mi) in the\n               central Indian Ocean. With about 18 million individuals, the Macaroni penguin is the most numerous penguin species. However,\n               widespread declines in populations have been recorded since the mid-1970s. These factors resulted in their conservation status\n               being reclassified as vulnerable. \n               \n            \n            \n            \n             \n               \n            \n            \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n         \n         \n            \n            Parent topic: Eudyptes (Crested penguins)\n            \n         \n         \n      \n       \n         \n         Taxonomy\n         \n         \n         \n             \n               \t \n               The Macaroni penguin was described from the Falkland Islands in 1837 by German naturalist Johann Friedrich von Brandt. It\n                  is one of six or so species in the genus Eudyptes, collectively known as crested penguins. The genus name is derived from\n                  the Ancient Greek words \n                  \t\teu \"good\", and \n                  \t\tdyptes \"diver\". The \n                  \t\tchrysolophus part is derived from the Greek words \n                  \t\tchryse \"golden\", and \n                  \t\tlophos \"crest\". \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n               The common name was recorded from the early 19th century in the Falkland Islands. English sailors apparently named the species\n                  for its conspicuous yellow crest; Maccaronism was a term for a particular style in 18th-century England marked by flamboyant\n                  or excessive ornamentation. A person who adopted this fashion was labelled a \n                  \t\tmaccaroni or \n                  \t\tmacaroni, as in the song \"'Yankee Doodle\". \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n                Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA evidence suggests that the Macaroni penguin split from its closest relative, the Royal Penguin\n                  (Eudyptes schlegeli), around 1.5 million years ago. Although the two have generally been considered separate species, the close similarities\n                  of their DNA sequences has led some, such as the Australian ornithologists Les Christidis and Walter Boles, to treat the Royal\n                  as a subspecies of the Macaroni. The two species are very similar in appearance, although the Royal Penguin has a white face\n                  instead of the usually black face of the Macaroni. Interbreeding with the Indopacific subspecies of the Southern Rockhopper\n                  Penguin (E. chrysocome filholi) has been reported at Heard and Marion Islands, with three hybrids recorded there by a 1987-88 Australian National Antarctic\n                  Research Expedition \n                  \t \n               \n               \n             \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n       \n         \n         Description\n         \n         \n         \n             \n               \t \n               The Macaroni penguin is a large, crested penguin, similar in appearance to other members of the genus \n                  \t\tEudyptes. An adult bird has an average length of around 70 cm (28 in); the weight varies markedly depending on time of year and sex.\n                  Males average from 3.3 kg (7 lb) after incubating, or 3.7 kg (8 lb) post-moult to 6.4 kg (14 lb) pre-moult, while females\n                  average 3.2 kg (7 lb) post-moult to 5.7 kg (13 lb) pre-moult. Among standard measurements, the thick bill (from the gape)\n                  measures 7 to 8 cm (2.8 to 3.1 in), the culmen being around a centimetre less. The wing, from the shoulder to the tip, is\n                  around 20.4 cm (8.0 in) and the tail is 9-10 cm (3.5-3.9 in) long. The head, chin, throat and upper parts are black and sharply\n                  demarcated against the white underparts. The black plumage has a bluish sheen when new and brownish when old. The most striking\n                  feature is the yellow crest that arises from a patch on the centre of the forehead, and extends horizontally backwards to\n                  the nape. The flippers are blue-black on the upper surface with a white trailing edge, and mainly white underneath with a\n                  black tip and leading edge. The large bulbous bill is orange-brown. The iris is red and there is a patch of pinkish bare skin\n                  from the base of the bill to the eye. The legs and feet are pink. The male and female are similar in appearance, although\n                  males tend to be slightly larger. Males also bear relatively larger bills, which average around 6.1 cm (2.4 in) compared to\n                  5.4 cm (2.1 in) in females; this feature has been used to tell the sexes apart. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n                \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n               Immature birds are distinguished by their smaller size, smaller duller brown bill, dark grey chin and throat, and absent or\n                  underdeveloped head plumes, often just a scattering of yellow feathers. The crest is fully developed in birds aged 3-4 years,\n                  a year or two before breeding age. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n               Macaroni penguins moult once a year, a process in which they replace all of their old feathers. They spend around two weeks\n                  accumulating fat before moulting because they do not feed during the moult, as they cannot enter the water to forage for food\n                  without feathers. The process typically takes three to four weeks, which they spend sitting ashore. Once finished, they go\n                  back to sea and return to their colonies to mate in the spring. Overall survival rates are poorly known; the successful return\n                  of breeding adults at South Georgia Island varied between 49 and 78% over three years, and around 10% of those that did return\n                  did not breed the following year. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n             \n            \t \n            \n               Vocalisation \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               The calls of this species are similar to other crested penguins; birds are especially noisy in colonies when establishing\n                  territories and forming pairs, and quiet down during incubation. During this period, parents make trumpeting calls when changing\n                  shifts at the nest; birds recognise each other more by voice than by location. A penguin calling for its chick or its mate\n                  has to compete with the vocalisations of potentially thousands of other birds - an environment with huge background noise\n                  and few visual cues. Field studies suggest that Macaroni penguins achieve this communication with the use of a display-call,\n                  a complex sound containing a unique acoustic signature for each bird. Calls recorded at colonies on South Georgia have a more\n                  rapid rhythm and lower pitch than those on Kerguelen and Crozet Islands. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n       \n         \n          Distribution and habitat\n         \n         \n         \n             \n               \t \n               A 1993 review estimated that the Macaroni was the most abundant species of penguin, with a minimum of 11,841,600 pairs of\n                  Macaroni penguins worldwide. Macaroni penguins range from the subantarctic to the - Antarctic Peninsula; at least 216 breeding\n                  colonies at 50 sites have been recorded. In South America, Macaroni penguins are found in southern Chile, the Falkland Islands,\n                  South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and South Orkney Islands. They also occupy much of Antarctica and the Antarctic\n                  Peninsula, including the northern South Shetland Islands, Bouvet Island, the Prince Edward and Marion islands, the Crozet\n                  Islands, the Kerguelen Islands, the Heard and McDonald Islands. While foraging for food, groups will range north to the islands\n                  off Australia, New Zealand, southern Brazil, Tristan da Cunha, and South Africa. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n             \n            \t \n             \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            \n               Conservation \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               Although the population of Macaroni penguins is estimated at around 18 million mature individuals, a substantial decline has\n                  been recorded in several locations. This includes a 50% reduction in the South Georgia population between the mid 1970s to\n                  mid 1990s, and the disappearance of the species from Isla Recalada in Southern Chile. This decline of the overall population\n                  in the last 30 years has resulted in the classification of the species as globally \n                  \t\t  Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Long-term monitoring programs are underway at a number of breeding colonies,\n                  and many of the islands that support breeding populations of this penguin are protected reserves. The Heard Islands and McDonald\n                  Islands are World Heritage Sites for the Macaroni penguin.The Macaroni penguin may be being impacted by commercial fishing\n                  and marine pollution. A 2008 study suggests that the abilities of female penguins to reproduce may be negatively affected\n                  by climate- and fishing-induced reductions in krill density \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n       \n         \n          Life history\n         \n         \n         \n             \n               \t \n               Like other penguin species, the Macaroni penguin is a social animal in its nesting and its foraging behaviour; its breeding\n                  colonies are among the largest and most densely populated of all penguin species. Outside the breeding season, the penguin\n                  is pelagic; birds disperse to sea from April or May until October. A 2009 study by a French team led by scientist Charles\n                  Andre Bost found that Macaroni penguins nesting at Kerguelen dispersed eastwards over an area exceeding 3×106 km2. Fitted with geolocation sensors, the 12 penguins studied travelled over 10,000 km (6,200 mi) in this period and spent their\n                  time largely within a zone 47-49° S and 70-110° E in the central Indian Ocean, not coming ashore once. This area, known as\n                  the Polar Frontal Zone, was notable for the absence of krill. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n               Living in colonies results in a high level of social interaction between birds, which has led to a large repertoire of visual\n                  as well as vocal displays. These behaviours peak early in the breeding period, and colonies particularly quieten when the\n                  male Macaroni penguins are at sea.Agonistic displays are those which are intended to confront or drive off, or alternatively, appease and avoid conflict with other individuals.\n                  Macaroni penguins, particularly those on adjacent nests, may engage in \n                  \t\tbill-jousting; birds lock bills and wrestle, each trying to unseat the other, as well as batter with flippers and peck or strike their\n                  opponent's nape. Submissive displays include the \n                  \t\tslender walk, where birds move through the colony with feathers flattened, flippers moved to the front of the body, and head and neck\n                  hunched, and general hunching of head and neck when incubating or standing at the nest. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n             \n            \t \n            \n               Diet \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               The diet of the Macaroni penguin consists of a variety of crustaceans, squid and fish, although the proportions that each\n                  makes up vary with locality and season. Krill, particularly Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), account for over 90% of food during breeding season. Cephalopods and small fish such as the Marbled rockcod (Notothenia rossii), Painted notie (Lepidonotothen larseni), \n                  \t\t   Champsocephalus gunneri \n                     \t\t  , the lanternfish species \n                  \t\t   Krefftichthys anderssoni \n                     \t\t  , \n                  \t\t   Protomyctophum tenisoni \n                     \t\t   and \n                  \t\t   P. normani \n                     \t\t   become more important during chick-rearing. Like several other penguin species, the Macaroni penguin sometimes deliberately\n                  swallows small (10-30 mm diameter) stones; this behaviour has been speculated to aid in providing ballast for deep-sea diving,\n                  or to help grind food, especially the exoskeletons of crustaceans that are a significant part of its diet. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               Foraging for food is generally conducted on a daily basis, from dawn to dusk when there are chicks to feed. Overnight trips\n                  are sometimes made, especially as the chicks grow older; a 2008 study that used surgically implanted data loggers to track\n                  the movement of the birds showed the foraging trips become longer once the chick-rearing period is over. Birds venture out\n                  for 10-20 days during incubation and before the moult. Macaroni penguins are known to be the largest single consumer of marine\n                  resources among all of the seabirds, with an estimated take of 9.2 million tonnes of krill a year. Outside the breeding season,\n                  Macaroni penguins tend to dive deeper, longer, and more efficiently during their winter migration than during the summer breeding\n                  season. Year round, foraging dives usually occur during daylight hours, but winter dives are more constrained by daylight\n                  due to the shorter days. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               Foraging distance from colonies has been measured at around 50 km (31 mi) at South Georgia, offshore over the continental\n                  shelf, and anywhere from 59 to 303 kilometres (37 to 188 mi) at Marion Island. Macaroni penguins normally forage at depths\n                  of 15 to 70 metres (49 to 230 ft), but have been recorded diving down to 100 metres (330 ft) on occasions. Some night foraging\n                  does occur, but these dives are much shallower, ranging from only 3 to 6 metres (9.8 to 20 ft) in depth. Dives rarely exceed\n                  two minutes in duration. All dives are V-shaped, and no time is spent at the sea bottom; about half the time on a foraging\n                  trip is spent diving. Birds have been calculated as catching anywhere from 4-16 krill or 40-50 amphipods per dive. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            \n               Predators \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               The Macaroni penguin's predators consist of birds and aquatic mammals. The Leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx), Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella), Subantarctic fur seal (A. tropicalis) and Killer whale (Orcinus orca) sometimes hunt adult Macaroni penguins in the water. Colonies suffer low rates of predation if undisturbed; predators generally\n                  only take eggs and young that have been left unattended or deserted. Skua species, the Snowy Sheathbill \n                  \t\t  (Chionis alba), and Kelp Gull (Larus dominicanus) prey on eggs, and skuas and Giant Petrels also sometimes take chicks. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            \n               Courtship and breeding \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               Female Macaroni penguins can begin breeding at around five years of age, while the males do not normally breed until at least\n                  six years old. Females breed at a younger age because the male population is larger. The surplus of male penguins allows the\n                  female penguins to select more experienced male partners as soon as the females are physically able to breed. Commencing a\n                  few days after females arrive to the colony, sexual displays are used by males to attract partners and advertise their territory,\n                  and by pairs once together at the nest site and at changeover of incubation shifts. In the \n                  \t\t  ecstatic display, a penguin bows forward, making loud throbbing sounds, and then extends its head and neck up until the neck and beak are\n                  vertical. The bird then waves its head from side to side braying loudly. Birds also engage in mutual bowing, trumpeting, and\n                  preening. Monitoring of pair fidelity at South Georgia has shown around three quarters of pairs will breed together again\n                  the following year. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n                \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               Adult Macaroni penguins typically begin to breed late in October, and lay their eggs in early November. The nest itself is\n                  a shallow scrape in the ground which may be lined with some pebbles, stones, or grass, or nestled in a clump of tussock grass\n                  (on South Georgia Island). Nests are densely packed, ranging from around 66 cm apart in the middle of a colony to 86 cm at\n                  the edges. A fertile Macaroni penguin will lay two eggs each breeding season. The first egg to be laid weighs 90-94 grams\n                  (3.2-3.3 oz), 61-64% the size of the 145-155-gram (5.1-5.5 oz) second, and is extremely unlikely to survive. The two eggs\n                  together weigh 4.8% of the mother's body weight; the composition of an egg is 20% yolk, 66% albumen, and 14% shell. Like those\n                  of other penguin species, the shell is relatively thick to minimise risk of breakage, and the yolk is large, which is associated\n                  with chicks born in an advanced stage of development. Some of the yolk remains at hatching and is consumed by the chick in\n                  its first few days. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               The fate of the first egg is mostly unknown, but studies on the related Royal Penguin and Erect-crested Penguin show the female\n                  tips the egg out when the larger second egg is laid. The task of incubating the egg is divided into three roughly equal sessions\n                  of around 12 days each over a five week period. The first session is shared by both parents, followed by the male returning\n                  to sea, leaving the female alone to tend the egg. Upon the male's return, the female goes off to sea and does not return until\n                  the chick has hatched. Both sexes fast for a considerable period during breeding; the male fasts for 37 days after arrival\n                  until he returns to sea for around ten days before fasting while incubating eggs and young for another 36 days, and the female\n                  fasts for 42 days from her arrival after the male until late in the incubation period. Both adults lose 36-40% of their body\n                  weight during this period. The second egg hatches around 34 days after it is laid. Macaroni penguins typically leave their\n                  breeding colony by April or May to disperse into the ocean. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n                \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               From the moment the egg is hatched, the male Macaroni penguin cares for the newly hatched chick. For about 23 to 25 days the\n                  male protects its offspring and helps to keep it warm, since only a few of its feathers have grown in by this time. The female\n                  brings food to the chick every one to two days. When they are not being protected by the adult male penguins, the chicks form\n                  crèches to keep warm and stay protected. Once their adult feathers have grown in at about 60-70 days, they are ready to go\n                  out to sea on their own \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n   ",

To help the fight against the oil spills, zoo representatives from all over\n                  the world come and adopt the hatchlings, and breed them there. The decline of fish populations is also responsible, as well\n                  as predators such as sea lions and giant petrels, which prey on the chicks \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               Climate change has displaced fish populations, so Magellanic penguins must swim an extra 25 miles (40 km) further from the\n                  nest for fish. While the penguins are swimming an extra 50 miles (80.4 km), their mates are sitting on a nest and starving.\n                  A colony being tracked by University of Washington professor P. Dee Boersma, about 1,000 miles (1,609 km) south of Buenos\n                  Aires, has fallen by more than 20 percent in the past 22 years, leaving 200,000 breeding pairs. Some younger penguins are\n                  now moving their breeding colonies north to be closer to fish, but, in some cases, this is putting them on private, unprotected\n                  lands. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               At present, 12 of 17 penguin species are experiencing rapid population declines. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n       \n         \n         Behaviour\n         \n         \n          \n            \t \n            \n               Diet \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               Magellanic penguins feed in the water, preying on cuttlefish, sardines, squid, krill, and other crustaceans, and ingest sea\n                  water with their prey.

At least 10 species live in the temperate zone; one, the\n            Galápagos Penguin, lives as far north as the Galápagos Islands, but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of\n            the Antarctic Humboldt Current that flows around these islands. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         Several authors have suggested that penguins are a good example of Bergmann's Rule where larger bodied populations live at\n            higher latitudes than smaller bodied populations. There is some disagreement about this, and several other authors have noted\n            that there are fossil penguin species that contradict this hypothesis and that ocean currents and upwellings are likely to\n            have had a greater effect on species diversity than latitude alone.\n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         Major populations of penguins are found in Antarctica, Argentina, Australia, Chile, New Zealand, and South Africa.\n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n         \n         \n            \n            Parent topic: Penguins Overview\n            \n         \n         \n      \n   ",

Most Antarctic\n                  penguin species nest in large high density aggregations of birds. In contrast yellow-eyed penguins do not nest within visual\n                  sight of each other. While they can be seen coming ashore in groups of 4-6 or more individuals then disperse along track to\n                  individual nests sites out of sight of each other. The consensus view of New Zealand penguin workers is that it is preferable\n                  to use habitat rather than colony to refer to areas where yellow-eyed penguins nest.Nest sites are selected in August and\n                  normally two eggs are laid in September. The incubation duties (lasting 39-51 days) are shared by both parents who may spend\n                  several days on the nest at a time. For the first six weeks after hatching, the chicks are guarded during the day by one parent\n                  while the other is at sea feeding. The foraging adult returns at least daily to feed the chicks and relieve the partner. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               After the chicks are six weeks of age, both parents go to sea to supply food to their rapidly growing offspring. Chicks usually\n                  fledge in mid February and are totally independent from then on. Chick fledge weights are generally between 5 and 6 kg. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               First breeding occurs at 3-4 years of age and long term partnerships are formed. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            \n               Predators \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               In the water they are killed by sharks and sea lions. A leopard seal or orca will do so too, but that is rather seldom. On\n                  the mainland they suffer a lot from introduced mammals like cats and dogs. Mustelids (ferrets, weasels, ...) and rats will\n                  rob eggs and small chicks from the nest. Destruction (clearing) of the forests on the coast and grazing cattle have a very\n                  negative influence on their population number too. And on remote islands, the birds have to suffer of the commercial overfishery,\n                  stealing their food. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n   ",

Hence, it is this particular\n                  species in which this behavior was first noted. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n             \n            \t \n            \n               Diet \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               These penguins feed on krill, squid, octopus, lantern fish, mollusks, plankton, cuttlefish, and mainly crustaceans. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            \n               Breeding \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               They breed in large, highly dense colonies on cliffs and slopes on several islands. The nests consist of shallow excavation\n                  sites, made with stones and vegetation. Caves and overhanging cliffs are preferred, while they offer protection against the\n                  weather. Rockhoppers conquer a lot for the best places and aggressive behaviour is normal practice with them. Some colonies\n                  are shared with the larger erect-crested penguins. There is a large time interval between the breeding season of the Northern\n                  subspecies (E.e.moseleyi) and the more southern breeding subspecies (E. c. chrysocome on Falklands etc.). The males arrive\n                  on the Falklands in October, two weeks later followed by the females. For the northern subspecies they arrive already in July.\n                  \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n                \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               Two eggs are laid (southern in November; northern in September), but, as usual among crested species, only the larger, secondly\n                  laid egg will hatch and the chick be raised. During incubation (32 till 34 days), the parents alternate with equally long\n                  shifts of 10 days. The males guard and take care for the hatched chick during the first period of 24-26 days, while the female\n                  forages and feeds the chick daily. Then the chicks form small creches and the parents both feed the chick. The chicks moult\n                  to their juvenile plumage and fledge in February (December-January at the northern subspecies) when they are 65 till 75 days\n                  old. The adults moult in April, after a period at sea to eat. For the northern subspecies, this period at sea before moulting\n                  lasts a lot longer (till up to 2 months) than for the southern one. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n   ",

Members of the family Hydrobatidae are increasingly called \n               \t\t   storm petrels; those of the Pelecanoididae are usually called \n               \t\t   diving petrels. \n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n            Among the procellariid petrels, some two dozen species of the genera Pterodroma and Bulweria are called \n               \t\t   gadfly petrels because their flight is more fluttering than that of the related shearwaters (see \n               \t\t   shearwater). Certain heavy-bodied petrels are known as \n               \t\t   fulmars, and one, Macronectes giganteus, is called both giant fulmar and giant petrel (see fulmar). \n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n            Gadfly petrels nest in loose colonies on islands in the tropical and subtropical regions of the major oceans. A single egg\n               (rarely two) is laid on the soil surface or in a burrow or crevice. The chick is tended by both parents and deserted about\n               a week before it is fully fledged; it completes its development on stored fat. During the non-breeding season, these birds\n               roam the open ocean, feeding on squid and small fish. Most gadfly petrels are dark above and light beneath, with long wings\n               and short, wedge-shaped tails. Because they are quite similar in appearance, the species are difficult to distinguish. \n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n            Some of the better known gadfly petrels are the endangered Bermuda petrel, or \n               \t\t   cahow (Pterodroma cahow, sometimes considered a race of P. hasitata); the dark-rumped petrel, also called the Hawaiian petrel (P.\n               phaeopygia), another endangered species, now concentrated almost entirely on the island of Maui; the phoenix petrel (P. alba),\n               which breeds on several tropical archipelagos; and the black-capped petrel, or diablotin (P. hasitata), formerly found throughout\n               the West Indies but now known only in Haiti. Several other species, including the Chatham Island (or magenta) petrel, the\n               Galápagos dark-rumped petrel, and the Réunion petrel, are also on the endangered list. \n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n            Several other procellariids are also called petrels.

The latter tend\n            to be confounded by the strong adaptive autapomorphies of the Sphenisciformes; a sometimes perceived fairly close relationship\n            between penguins and grebes is almost certainly an error based on both groups' strong diving adaptations, which are homoplasies.\n            On the other hand, different DNA sequence datasets do not agree in detail with each other either. \n         \n         \n         \t\t\n         What seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of Neoaves (living birds except paleognaths and fowl) that comprises what\n            is sometimes called \"higher waterbirds\" to distinguish them from the more ancient waterfowl.

Some think the penguin-like plotopterids (usually considered relatives of anhingas and cormorants) may actually be a sister group of the penguins, and that penguins\n            may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the Pelecaniformes and consequently would have to be included in that order,\n            or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting\n            the traditional Pelecaniformes in three. \n         \n         \n         \t\t\n         Enter an example that illustrates the current task (optional).\n         \n         \t\n      \n      \n      \n      \n         \n         \n            \n            Parent topic: Systematics and evolution\n            \n         \n         \n      \n   ",

Storks have no syrinx and are mute, giving\n            no call; bill-clattering is an important mode of communication at the nest. Many species are migratory. Most storks eat frogs,\n            fish, insects, earthworms, small birds and small mammals.

Some nests have been known to grow to over two metres (six\n            feet) in diameter and about three metres (ten feet) in depth. Storks were once thought to be monogamous, but this is only\n            partially true. They may change mates after migrations, and may migrate without a mate.

The tail is a little longer than other penguins' tails. The appearance looks somewhat like a tuxedo. They are a\n                  little smaller than other penguin species.

When they had succeeded in pushing one of their number over, all would crane their necks\n                  over the edge, and when they saw the pioneer safe in the water, the rest followed.\" \n                  \t \n               \n               \n             \n            \t \n            \n               Diet \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               Adélies feed almost exclusively on krill (99 % of their diet). Most of the time they forage on a depth between 10 till 40\n                  metres, although their record is much deeper. They dive for fish during the daytime, when the light is the most bright under\n                  water. When feeding chicks, they stay close to the colony and return daily to the nest. After breeding they migrate far away\n                  from the colony and stay away for weeks. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            \n               Breeding \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               Adélie penguins build a rough nest of stones. They start breeding when they are between 3 till 8 years old. The males arrive\n                  in the colony in the first half of October, after walking tens (30-100) of kilometres over the pack ice. They nest close to\n                  each other between rocks, on hills and ridges in large colonies of up to thousands of pairs. As soon as they found a suitable\n                  nesting place, they start calling out loud to attract a female, with their bill up to the air and their flippers wide open.\n                  When a female reacts, they call together and bow for each other several times. Then mating follows. End October-early November\n                  (6 till 10 days after female arrival), she lays two eggs, which will alternately be incubated by both parents during 32 till\n                  34 days (in shifts of max 12 days). \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               After hatching, the chicks stay 22 days in the nest, where they are (also alternately) be guarded and fed by one parent or\n                  the other, till they are ready to congregate in crèches. Such crèche isn't large and mostly includes 10-20 chicks. The chicks\n                  are almost daily fed. They moult to their juvenile plumage and fledge end January to early February when they are 50 à 60\n                  days old. In the meanwhile it is summer on Antarctica and the pack ice is broken, so the chicks haven't to walk that far to\n                  open sea. Often you can see a chick with a little of down, standing on a floating iceberg or ice floe, while the chicks often\n                  leave before moulting is completed. When the breeding period is over, the adult birds leave for a forage trip at sea for about\n                  ten days, before returning mid March to moult themselves. The moulting period lasts around 20 days. Early April the colony\n                  is completely abandoned till early October a new breeding season begins. Many pairs are loyal for live and return each year\n                  to their same old nest. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               Adélie penguins arrive at their breeding grounds in October or November, at the end of winter and the start of spring. Their\n                  nests consist of stones piled together. In December, the warmest month in Antarctica (about −2 °C or 28 °F), the parents take\n                  turns incubating the egg; one goes to feed and the other stays to warm the egg. The parent who is incubating does not eat.\n                  In March, the adults and their young return to the sea. The Adélie penguin lives on sea ice but needs the ice-free land to\n                  breed. With a reduction in sea ice and a scarcity of food, populations of the Adélie penguin have dropped by 65% over the\n                  past 25 years. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n                \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            \n               Predators \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               Adélie penguins are preyed on by leopard seals, \n                  \t\t  Skuas, and occasionally, orcas. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n   ",

Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark\n            and white plumage, and their wings have evolved into flippers. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid, and other forms of\n            sealife caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their lives on land and half in the oceans. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as Antarctica.\n            In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the temperate zone, and one species,\n            the Galápagos Penguin, lives near the equator. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         The largest living species is the Emperor Penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri): on average adults are about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall\n            and weigh 35 kg (75 lb) or more. The smallest penguin species is the Little Blue Penguin (Eudyptula minor), also known as\n            the Fairy Penguin, which stands around 40 cm tall (16 in) and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins, larger penguins\n            inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates (see also Bergmann's\n            Rule). Some prehistoric species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human. These were not restricted\n            to Antarctic regions; on the contrary, subantarctic regions harboured high diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred\n            in a region not quite 2,000 km south of the equator 35 mya, in a climate decidedly warmer than today. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n         \n         \n            \n            Parent topic: Penguins Overview\n            \n         \n         \n      \n   ",

The exact number varies between\n               four and seven depending on the authority, and a Chatham Islands species may have become extinct in the 19th century. All\n               are black and white penguins with yellow crests and red bills and eyes, and are found on subantarctic islands in the world's\n               southern oceans. All lay two eggs but raise only one young per breeding season; the first egg laid is substantially smaller\n               than the second. \n               \n            \n            \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n         \n         \n            \n            Fiordland penguin (Eudyptes pachyrhynchus)\n               \n            \n            \n            Snares penguin (Eudyptes robustus)\n               \n            \n            \n            Southern Rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes chrysocome)\n               \n            \n            \n            Northern Rockhopper Penguin (Eudyptes moseleyi)\n               \n            \n            \n            Macaroni penguin (Eudyptes chrysolophus)\n               \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n         \n            \n            Parent topic: Types of penguins\n            \n         \n         \n      \n       \n         \n         Taxonomy\n         \n         \n         \n             \n               \t \n               The genus was described by the French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1816; the name is derived from the Ancient\n                  Greek words \n                  \t\teu \"good\", and \n                  \t\tdyptes \"diver\". \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n               Six extant species have been classically recognised, with the recent splitting of the Rockhopper Penguin increasing it to\n                  seven.

Their calls are more complex than those of other species, with several phrases of differing lengths.The Royal\n               Penguin (mostly) has a white face, while other species have black faces. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n       \n         \n         Breeding\n         \n         \n          \n            \t \n            Crested penguins breed on subantarctic islands in the southern reaches of the world's oceans; the greatest diversity occurring\n               around New Zealand and surrounding islands. Their breeding displays and behaviours are generally more complex than other penguin\n               species. Both male and female parents take shifts incubating eggs and young. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            Crested penguins lay two eggs but almost always raise only one young successfully. All species exhibit the odd phenomenon\n               of \n               \t\tegg-size dimorphism in breeding; the first egg (or A-egg) laid is substantially smaller than the second egg (B-egg). This is most extreme in\n               the Macaroni Penguin, where the first egg averages only 60% the size of the second. The reason for this is a mystery, although\n               several theories have been proposed, remains unknown. British ornithologist David Lack theorized the genus was evolving toward\n               the laying of a one-egg clutch. Experiments with egg substitution have shown that A-eggs can produce viable chicks which were\n               only 7% lighter at time of fledging. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            Recently, brooding Royal and Erect-crested Penguins have been reported to tip the smaller eggs out as the second is laid.\n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n       \n         \n         Species\n         \n         \n          \n            \t \n            \n            \n               \n                  \n                     \n                     \n                     \n                     \n                  \n                   \n                     \t\t\t \n                      \n                        \t\t\t\t\n                        Common and binomial names \n                           \t\t\t\t\n                        \n                        \n                        \t\t\t\t\n                        Image \n                           \t\t\t\t\n                        \n                        \n                        \t\t\t\t\n                        Description \n                           \t\t\t\t\n                        \n                        \n                        \t\t\t\t\n                        Range \n                           \t\t\t\t\n                        \n                        \n                        \t\t\t \n                     \n                     \n                     \t\t  \n                  \n                  \n                   \n                     \t\t\t \n                      \n                        \t\t\t\t\n                        Fiordland Penguin (Eudyptes pachyrhynchus) \n                           \t\t\t\t\n                        \n                        \n                        \t\t\t\t\n                         \n                           \t\t\t\t\n                        \n                        \n                        \t\t\t\t\n                        Medium-sized, yellow-crested, black-and-white penguins, growing to approximately 60 cm (24 in) long and weighing on average\n                           3.7 kg (8.2 lbs), with a weight range of 2 to 5.95 kg (4.4 to 13.1 lb).

The hotter the penguin gets, the more blood is sent to these\n               glands so it may be cooled by the surrounding air, thus making the glands more pink. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            This species exhibits slight sexual dimorphism: the males are larger than the females and have larger beaks. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n             The beak is more pointed than that of the Humboldt.

A penguin may consume up to 540 grams of prey every day, but this may increase to over\n                  1 kg when raising older chicks. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               Due to the collapse of a commercial pilchard fishery in 1960, the African penguin has resorted to eating anchovies. Although\n                  it keeps the penguins alive, it is not their ideal meal due to the low concentration of fat and protein. Their diet changes\n                  throughout the year and it is believed that their aspect of breeding help the penguins maintain their population size. Upon\n                  having hatchlings, although the parent penguins are protective of their hatchlings, the parents will not sacrifice their appetite\n                  for their children. If even in a situation where food is scarce, adult parents will let their children starve before they\n                  let themselves starve. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            \n               Breeding \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               The African penguin is monogamous. It breeds in colonies, and pairs return to the same site each year. The African penguin\n                  has an extended breeding season, with nesting usually peaking from March to May in South Africa, and November and December\n                  in Namibia. A clutch of two eggs are laid either in burrows dug in guano, or scrapes in the sand under boulders or bushes.\n                  Incubation is undertaken equally by both parents for about 40 days. At least one parent guards the chicks until about 30 days,\n                  whereafter the chick joins a creche with other chicks, and both parents head out to sea to forage each day. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               Chicks fledge at 60 to 130 days, the timing depending on environmental factors such as quality and availability of food. The\n                  fledged chick then go to sea on their own and return to their natal colony after a lengthy time period of 12-22 months to\n                  molt into adult plumage. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               When penguins molt, they are unable to forage as their new feathers are not waterproof yet; therefore they fast over the entire\n                  molting period, which in African penguins takes about 20 days. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n                \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               The African penguin's lifespan consists of mainly breeding.The aim of their existence is basically to produce strong and fertile\n                  offspring in order to keep their species alive, and females remain fertile for 10 years. Penguins spend most of their lives\n                  at sea until it comes time for them to lay their eggs. Due to the high predation by larger mammals inland, the penguins will\n                  go offshore to an island for protection from mammals and natural challenges. African penguins usually breed during the African\n                  winter when temperatures are less torrid. Although it is winter, the heat on the island is still scorching. The penguins need\n                  to find protection for their eggs. In order to do this; they dig guano holes and incubate the penguins there. Due to humans,\n                  though, the amount of guano on the land has significantly dropped. To compensate, penguins dig holes in the sand. Although\n                  effective, the sand gets hot and fills with water during rain easily. The penguins spend three weeks on land to provide for\n                  their offsprings. The eggs are 3-4 times bigger than hen's eggs. Parents usually feed hatchlings during dusk or dawn. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n   ",

Adults of the two species can be separated by the colour of their bill-tip:\n            greenish in the southern and reddish in the northern. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n          \n            \t\t\n             \n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         This petrel is the largest of the Procellariidae and measures 86-99 cm (34-39 in) with a wingspan of 185-205 cm (73-81 in).\n            The male weighs approximately 5 kg (11 lb) and the female 3-8 kg (6.6-17.6 lb). They have a very large yellow bill, with a\n            green tip and greyish-brown legs. There are two different morphs, the dark which resembles the northern giant petrel, and\n            the more distinct light morph. On the dark morph the upper breast, head and neck are light with the remainder of its plumage\n            being mottled brown. The leading edge of its wing is lighter as is the base of the inner primaries, on the underside. The\n            light morph is rarer and very distinct with only slight black speckles on an otherwise all white look. As juveniles, the dark\n            morph starts off more sooty brown and pales as it ages. Both giant petrels have strong legs and can move around on land effectively.\n            Finally, when in flight this species has a somewhat hunchbacked appearance. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         Like all members of the Procellariiformes, they have certain features that set them apart from other birds. First, they have\n            nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called naricorns. Although the nostrils on the petrels are on the top of the\n            bill. The bills of all Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between seven and nine horny plates.\n            Finally, they produce a stomach oil made up of wax esters and triglycerides that is stored in the proventriculus. This can\n            be sprayed out of their mouths as a defence against predators as well as used as an energy rich food source for chicks and\n            for the adults during their long flights. They also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate\n            their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe; it excretes a concentrated saline solution from the\n            nostrils. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         For more information: \n            \t\thttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_giant_petrel\n            \t \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n         \n         \n            \n            Parent topic: Petrels\n            \n         \n         \n      \n   ",

It may be derived from the Welsh pen gwyn\n            \"white head\", although the etymology is debated. When European explorers discovered what are today known as penguins in the\n            Southern Hemisphere, they noticed their similar appearance to the Great Auk of the northern hemisphere, and named them after\n            this bird, although they are not related.\n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         The etymology of the word \"penguin\" is still debated. The English word is not apparently of French, nor of Breton or Spanish\n            origin (both attributed to the French word pingouin \"auk\"), but first appears in English or Dutch.\n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         Some dictionaries suggest a derivation from Welsh pen, \"head\" and gwyn, \"white\", including the Oxford English Dictionary,\n            the American Heritage Dictionary, the Century Dictionary and Merriam-Webster, on the basis that the name was originally applied\n            to the great auk, either because it was found on White Head Island (Welsh Pen Gwyn) in Newfoundland, or because it had white\n            circles around its eyes (though the head was black).\n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         An alternative etymology links the word to Latin pinguis which means \"fat\". In Dutch the alternative word for penguin is 'fat-goose'\n            ('vetgans' see: Dutch wiki or dictionaries under Pinguïn), and would indicate this bird received its name from its appearance.\n            \t \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n         \n         \n            \n            Parent topic: Penguins Overview\n            \n         \n         \n      \n   ",

Analysis of\n               a part of a mitochondrial control region from a Northern Rockhopper Penguin found on the Kerguelen Islands showed that it\n               may have come from Gough Island, 6,000 km away, and that the Southern and Northern Rockhoppers are genetically separate, though\n               some individuals may disperse from their breeding colonies.

It appears to have been a distinct species, with a thin, slim and low bill. As of 2009, the species\n                  has not been formally described.

In New Zealand, they are also called Little Blue Penguins, or just Blue Penguins, owing to their slate-blue\n                  plumage, and they are called Korora in Maori. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n                \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n      \n      \n       \n         \n         M\n         \n         \n          \n            \n            Macaroni Penguin, Eudyptes chrysolophus \n               \n            \n            \n            \n             \n               \t \n               The \n                  \t\tMacaroni Penguin (Eudyptes chrysolophus) is a species of penguin found from the Subantarctic to the Antarctic Peninsula. One of six species of crested penguin, it\n                  is very closely related to the Royal Penguin, and some authorities consider the two to be a single species. It bears a distinctive\n                  yellow crest, and the face and upperparts are black and sharply delineated from the white underparts. Adults weigh on average\n                  5.5 kg (12 lb) and are 70 cm (28 in) in length. The male and female are similar in appearance although the male is slightly\n                  larger with a relatively larger bill. Like all penguins, it is flightless, with a streamlined body and wings stiffened and\n                  flattened into flippers for a marine lifestyle. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n               Its diet consists of a variety of crustaceans, mainly krill, as well as small fish and cephalopods; the species consumes more\n                  marine life annually than any other species of seabird. These birds moult once a year, spending about three to four weeks\n                  ashore, before returning to the sea. Numbering up to 100,000 individuals, the breeding colonies of the Macaroni Penguin are\n                  among the largest and densest of all penguin species. After spending the summer months breeding, penguins disperse into the\n                  oceans for six months; a 2009 study found that Macaroni Penguins from Kerguelen travelled over 10,000 km (6,200 mi) in the\n                  central Indian Ocean. With about 18 million individuals, the Macaroni Penguin is the most numerous penguin species. However,\n                  widespread declines in populations have been recorded since the mid-1970s. These factors resulted in their conservation status\n                  being reclassified as vulnerable. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n                \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n          \n            \n            Magellanic Penguin, Spheniscus magellanicus \n               \n            \n            \n            \n             \n               \t \n               The \n                  \t\tMagellanic Penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus)is a South American penguin, breeding in coastal Argentina, Chile and the Falkland Islands, with some migrating to Brazil\n                  where they are occasionally seen as far north as Rio de Janeiro.

They vary in size from about 11 to 45 cm (4 to 18 inches)\n            in length. Their loud calls reveal their presence in dense vegetation. Many are excellent game birds; when flushed, they take\n            wing reluctantly, fly a short distance, and then drop to the ground. Their slender build facilitates running through reeds\n            and marsh grasses. They are mostly dull coloured in grays and browns. Many are barred in irregular patterns.

The species breeds\n               on The Snares, a group of islands off the southern coast of the South Island. This is a medium-small, yellow-crested penguin,\n               at a size of 50-70 cm (20-28 in) and a weight of 2.5-4 kg (5.5-8.8 lbs).

However, Hutton lost his sample at sea before a full speciation could be identified. A description\n               written by Hutton and an illustration done by Keulemans in Buller's \"A History of the Birds of New Zealand\" are evidence that\n               this is the same penguin previously identified by Hutton. However, there is some debate over the classification of this penguin,\n               and Oliver was able to successfully propose that a few slight anatomical differences did exist between the Snares penguins\n               and the early description and illustration, leading the Snares penguin to be called \n               \t\trobustus instead of \n               \t\tatratus. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n       \n         \n         Description\n         \n         \n          \n            \t \n            The Snares penguin is often compared to \n               \t\tFiordland penguin (Eudyptes pachyrhynchus), which is related by the genus of Crested Penguins (Eudyptes). Snares penguins can be distinguished from Fiordland penguins\n               by a patch of skin at the base of their beaks. The Snares penguin is similarly colored to other species of penguins, having\n               a black head, back and flippers with a white belly. A bright-yellow crest, beginning at the base of the bill, runs along the\n               upper part of the head on both sides and ends at the back of the head. It has a thick reddish-brown beak, traced with light\n               pink skin at the base. The eyes are generally described as a bright red-brown color, but this coloration can vary somewhat\n               between individuals and in different lighting. The color patterns under the wings differ from individual to individual, so\n               it is not a good characteristic for species identification. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            The penguin can make a large variety of vocal noises. It is difficult to verbally describe these noises, but they range from\n               hisses and explosive cries when threatened to rhythmical braying and trumpeting sounds that can be heard from long distances\n               at sea. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n       \n         \n         Distribution and habitat\n         \n         \n          \n             \n               \t \n               The Snares penguin is named after the place in which it breeds-the Snares Islands. The Snares Islands are a small group of\n                  islands off the coast of southern New Zealand. Although little is known of their range and migration outside of the breeding\n                  season, it is not thought that they migrate far in the winters. Occasional sitings have occurred on the coasts of Tasmania,\n                  southern Australia, the Chatham Islands, Stewart Island, and the southern New Zealand mainland. There are approximately 25,000\n                  living pairs of Snares penguins. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n               Snares penguins nest in dense colonies under the tree cover of the Olearia forests or on coastal rocks. To build a nest, the\n                  penguins dig up shallow holes in the ground and layer the bottom with grass, leaves, twigs, peat, or pebbles. A small rim\n                  of mud is added to the rim of the nest to raise it above ground level. Vegetation at nesting sites dies dues to the dense\n                  nesting activities, and the colony moves to a new nesting site. Colonies nesting near streams may have some advantage, as\n                  the stream provides water for drinking and bathing. However, it is not essential that nesting colonies are located near a\n                  stream since many are far from any streams. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n             \n            \t \n            \n               Conservation \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               Although Snares penguins are not currently threatened, they are considered a vulnerable species. If a threat arose, it could\n                  quickly wipe out their population because their breeding grounds are confined to a small island group. Possible threats include\n                  the introduction of a new predator, overfishing around the islands that would deplete their food source, increasing water\n                  temperatures from global warming driving prey away, and pollution. The New Zealand government has taken action to protect\n                  the Snares Islands habitats and marine feeding grounds. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n       \n         \n         Behavior\n         \n         \n          \n            \t \n            \n               Diet \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               The diet of Snares penguins usually consists of krill of the species Nyctiphanes australis, small fish, and cephalopods. One\n                  study found that about 60 percent of the mass of stomach contents from Snares penguins consisted of krill, 30 percent was\n                  fish, and about 10 percent was cephalopods. The researchers concluded that the number of fish otoliths and cephalopod beaks\n                  indicated the importance of these types of prey to adult penguins while at sea. Another study reports the diet consisting\n                  of about 55 percent krill, 24 percent fish, and 21 percent cephalopods, also suggesting that fish and cephalopods are more\n                  important prey types than the percentages of stomach composition indicate. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            \n               Foraging Ecology \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               The foraging patterns of breeding Snares penguins is well defined. After shared incubation of eggs, males leave on two week\n                  long foraging trips, which has been found to be synchronized with spring plankton blooms, as they are reliable predictors\n                  of food sources . Upon the return of the males, the females go on somewhat shorter foraging trips (less than a week), returning\n                  in time for the chicks to hatch. Throughout the chick guard stage, the female is the lone provider of food performing short\n                  foraging trips (one to three days). While male penguins performing long foraging trips reach depths of up to 120m, chick rearing\n                  birds usually exhibit shallow pursuit diving strategies (average dive depths 20-40m) to catch prey . \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            \n               Predators \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               Predators of adult Snares penguins are sea lions and leopard seals.

Snares penguins begin reproducing in the age range of five to nine years old. To court the females, single males\n                  stand erect with their wings spread out and pumping their chest. It is likely that the pairs remain faithful to each other\n                  for more than one season. The pairs then build a nest, most of the work being done by the male. The female lays two eggs,\n                  typically about three to five days apart, which hatch 31-37 days later. The second laid egg is up to 85 percent larger than\n                  the first and also hatches first. The smaller, last-hatched chick is outcompeted by its siblings and usually does not survive,\n                  also called \"siblicide\". Egg-size dimorphism is particularly large in Snares penguins, and the larger egg hatching first only\n                  accentuates the sibling size difference. Hatching pattern and size-dimorphic eggs are two of the mechanisms by which birds\n                  can change their breeding pattern in response to environmental and breeding conditions. In altricial birds, such as Snares\n                  penguins, egg-size variation and asynchronous hatching are adaptive mechanisms that may lead to brood reduction. However,\n                  Snares penguins and other members of their genus, \n                  \t\t  Eudyptes, differ from most other birds in that their last laid egg is larger and hatches first rather than being the smallest and\n                  last to hatch. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n                Egg incubation does not occur until both eggs have been laid, and they are usually incubated one in front of the other. The\n                  smaller, first-laid egg is often placed in the anterior position for incubation, which is thought to be the less favorable\n                  location since they have lower and more variable temperatures during incubation. Although the smaller, first egg receives\n                  less favorable incubation, it was found that egg-size dimorphism affects the hatching pattern in Snares penguins instead of\n                  egg incubation position. Both parents partake in incubating the eggs. For the first ten days, they alternate. Then the male\n                  leaves for an extended period (about 12 days) to forage for food, while the mother stays with the eggs. When he returns, the\n                  roles are reversed. Also, upon his return, the pair engages in a display of bowing and trumpeting, which further strengthens\n                  their bond. For the first three weeks after hatching, the male guards the chicks from predators while the female searches\n                  for food, returning each day to feed her offspring. It was observed that parents can recognize their chicks and chicks can\n                  recognize their parents. The study found that calls between chick and parent were more important for recognition than visual\n                  cues. The parents provide food for their young each day until it has molted and can forage for its own food. The chicks fledge\n                  at approximately 11 weeks. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n   ",

Fossil evidence of a third species-Ridgen's Penguin (A. ridgeni)-has\n                  been found in fossil records from the late Pliocene, about three million years ago, in New Zealand. Studies of penguin behaviour\n                  and genetics have proposed that the genus Aptenodytes is basal; in other words, that it split off from a branch which led to all other living penguin species. Mitochondrial and\n                  nuclear DNA evidence suggests this split occurred around 40 million years ago. \n               \n               \n               \t\t\t\n            \n            \t\t\t\n            \n               Subspecies\n               In 1911, the ornithologist Gregory Mathews proposed the two subspecies currently recognised: \n               \n                \n                  \n                     \t\t\t\t\n                      A. p. patagonicus breeds on South Georgia and Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic. \n                     \n                     \n                     \t\t\t\t\n                      A. p. halli breeds on the Kerguelen, Crozet Prince Edward, Heard, and Macquarie Islands. \n                     \n                     \n                     \t\t\t\n                  \n                  \n               \n               \n            \n            \n            \t\t\n         \n         \n         \t\n      \n      \n      \t\n      \n         \t\t\n          Description\n         \n         \t\t\n         \n            \t\t\t\n            \n               \t\t\t\t\n               The king penguin is the second largest species of penguin at about 90 cm (3.0 ft) tall and weighing 11 to 16 kg (24 to 35\n                  lb), second only to the Emperor Penguin. Like all penguin species, it has a streamlined body to minimise drag while swimming,\n                  webbed feet to propel more force when swimming, and wings that have become stiff, flat flippers. There is little difference\n                  in plumage between the male and female, although the latter are slightly smaller. The upper parts features of the king penguin\n                  include a silvery-grey back with a blackish-brown head decorated with ear patches of bright golden-orange. However, rare individuals\n                  have been sighted that have varying degrees of melanism, including one individual spotted on a National Geographic Society expedition to South Georgia Island that was completely black. The 12-13 cm (4¾-5 in) black bill is long and slender, and\n                  curved downwards like a banana peel. The lower mandible bears a striking pink or orange-coloured mandibular plate. \n               \n               \n               \t\t\t\t\n               \n                  \t\t\t\t\t\n                  \t\t\t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\t\t\n               The chick is not the first covered with brown-grey down, before moulting into a thick, woolly brown coat borne until around\n                  10-12 months of age. Their mandibular plates are black until the moult into immature plumage. An immature bird will have yellow,\n                  rather than orange-tinged markings, and grey tips to its black brown feathers. It moults into adult plumage after reaching\n                  two years of age. \n               \n               \n               \t\t\t\t\n               King penguins live for an average of 15 to 20 years in the wild. \n               \n               \t\t\t\n            \n            \t\t\t\n            \n                Adaptations to the environment\n               King penguins have adapted well to their extreme living conditions in the subantarctic. To keep warm, the penguins have four\n                  layers of feathering. King penguins have 70 feathers per every square inch. The outer layer of feathers are oiled and waterproof,\n                  unlike the feathering of a duck, which reduces the amount of water absorbed that would otherwise increase their weight. The\n                  inner three layers are down feathers, very effective insulation. A chick is born without the oily outer layer, and therefore\n                  cannot fish until immaturity. A king penguin chick has dark down feathers. They remain on land and do not go into the water\n                  until their down feathers have fallen off. \n               \n               \n            \n            \n            \t\t\t\n            \n                Drinking\n               Like most penguins, king penguins are able to drink salt water because of their supraorbital glands which filter excess salt\n                  from their blood stream by way of a capillary just above the eyes. The excess salt is then expelled through the nostrils as\n                  a concentrated brine. \n               \n               \n            \n            \n            \t\t\n         \n         \n         \t\n      \n      \n      \t\n      \n         \t\t\n          Distribution and habitat\n         \n         \t\t\n         \n            \t\t\t\n            King penguins breed on subantarctic islands between 45 and 55°S, at the northern reaches of Antarctica, as well as Tierra\n               del Fuego, the Falkland Islands, and other temperate islands of the region. The total population is estimated to be 2.23 million\n               pairs and is increasing. The largest breeding populations are on Crozet Island, with around 455,000 pairs, 228,000 pairs on\n               the Prince Edward Islands, 240,000-280,000 on the Kerguelen Islands and over 100,000 on the South Georgia Islands. Macquarie\n               Island has around 70,000 pairs. The non-breeding range is poorly known though presumably the subantarctic waters of the southern\n               Indian, South Atlantic and Asian part of the Southern Ocean. Vagrant birds have been recorded from the Antarctic peninsula\n               as well as South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. \n            \n            \n            \t\t\t\n            The Nature Protection Society released king penguins in Gjesvær in Finnmark, and Røst in Lofoten in northern Norway in August\n               1936. Birds were reported in the area several times in the 1940s though none have been seen since 1949. \n            \n            \n            \t\t\t\n            \n               \t\t\t\t\n               \t\t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n         \n         \n         \t\n      \n      \n      \t\n      \n         \t\t\n          Behavior\n         \n         \t\t\n         \n            \t\t\t\n            \n               \t\t\t\t\n               American zoologist Gerry Kooyman revolutionized the study of penguin foraging behaviour in 1971 when he published his results\n                  from attaching automatic dive-recording devices to Emperor Penguins, and recording a dive of 235 metres (771 ft) by a king\n                  penguin in 1982. The current maximum dive recorded is 343 metres in the Falkland Islands region, and a maximum time submerged\n                  of 552 seconds recorded at the Crozet Islands. The king penguin dives to depths of 100-300 meters (350-1000 feet), spending\n                  around 5 minutes submerged, during daylight hours, and less than 30 metres (98 ft) at night. \n               \n               \n               \t\t\t\t\n               The majority (around 88% in one study) of dives undertaken by king penguins are flat-bottomed; that is, the penguin dives\n                  to a certain depth and remains there for a period of time hunting (roughly 50% of total dive time) before returning to the\n                  surface. They have been described as U-shaped or W-shaped, relating to the course of the dive. The bird dives in a V-shaped\n                  or 'spike' pattern in the remaining 12% of dives; that is the bird dives at an angle through the water column, reaches a certain\n                  depth and then returns to the surface. Other penguins dive in this latter foraging pattern in contrast. Observations at Crozet\n                  Islands revealed most King penguins were seen within 30 km (19 mi) of the colony. Using the average swimming speed, Kooyman\n                  estimated the distance travelled to foraging areas at 28 km (17 mi). \n               \n               \n               \t\t\t\t\n               Its average swimming speed is 6.5-10 km/h (4-6 mph). On shallower dives under 60 m (200 ft), it averages 2 km/h (1.2 mph)\n                  descending and ascending, while on deeper dives over 150 m (490 ft) deep, it averages 5 km/h (3.1 mph) in both directions.\n                  King penguins also porpoise, a swimming technique used to breathe while maintaining speed. On land, the king penguin alternates\n                  between walking with a wobbling gait and tobogganing-sliding over the ice on its belly, propelled by its feet and wing-like\n                  flippers. Like all penguins, it is flightless \n               \n               \n               \t\t\t\n            \n            \t\t\t\n            \n                Diet King penguins eat small fish, and squid and rely less than most Southern Ocean predators on krill and other crustaceans.\n               Fish constitute 80-100% of the diet, except in winter months of July and August, when they make up only 30%. Lanternfish are\n               the main fish taken, principally the species Electrona carlsbergi and Krefftichthys anderssoni, as well as Protomyctophum\n               tenisoni. Slender escolar ( Paradiplospinus gracilis) of the Gempylidae, and Champsocephalus gunneri, is also consumed. Cephalopods\n               consumed include those of the genus Moroteuthis , the Nopehooked squid species Kondakovia longimana, the Sevenstar Flying\n               Squid (Martialia hyadesii ), young Gonatus antarcticus and Onychoteuthis species \n            \n            \n            \t\t\t\n            \n                Predators\n               The King Penguin's predators include birds and aquatic mammals: \n               \n                \n                  \n                     \t\t\t\t\n                      Skuas take small chicks and eggs. \n                     \n                     \n                     \t\t\t\t\n                     The Snowy sheathbill (Chionis albus) scavenges for dead chicks and unattended eggs. \n                     \n                     \n                     \t\t\t\t\n                     The Leopard Seal (Hydrurga leptonyx) takes adult birds at sea. \n                     \n                     \t\t\t\t\n                      Orcas may also hunt king penguins. \n                     \n                     \t\t\t\t\n                      Antarctic Fur Seals on Marion Island have also been seen chasing king penguins on the beach, killing and eating them. It\n                        seems that especially males, and particularly sub-adults males, are involved \n                     \n                     \n                     \t\t\t\n                  \n                  \n               \n               \n            \n            \n            \t\t\t\n            \n                Courtship and breeding\n               The king penguin is able to breed at three years of age, although only a very small minority (5% recorded at Crozet Islands)\n                  actually do then; the average age of first breeding is around 6 years. King penguins are serially monogamous. They have only\n                  one mate each year, and stay faithful to that mate. However, fidelity between years is only about 29%. The long breeding cycle\n                  may contribute to this low rate. \n               \n               \n               The king penguin has an unusually prolonged breeding cycle, taking some 14-16 months from laying to offspring fledging. Although\n                  pairs will attempt to breed annually, they are generally only successful one year in two, or two years in three in a triennial\n                  pattern on South Georgia. The reproductive cycle begins in September to November, as birds return to colonies for a prenuptial\n                  moult. Those that were unsuccessful in breeding the previous season will often arrive earlier. They then return to the sea\n                  for three weeks before coming ashore in November or December. \n               \n               \n               \n                  \t\t\t\t\n                  \t\t\t\n               \n               \n                The female penguin lays one pyriform (pear-shaped) white egg weighing 300 g (⅔ lb). It is initially soft, but hardens and\n                  darkens to a pale greenish colour. It measures around 10 cm × 7 cm (3.9 in × 2.8 in). The egg is incubated for around 55 days\n                  with both birds sharing incubation in shifts of 6-18 days each. Hatching may take up to 2-3 days to complete, and chicks are\n                  born semi-altricial and nidicolous. In other words, they have only a thin covering of down and are entirely dependent on their\n                  parents for food and warmth. The guard phase starts with the birth of the chick. The young chick is spends its time balanced\n                  on its parents' feet and is sheltered by its pouch (abdominal skin). During this time, the parents alternate every 3-7 days,\n                  one guarding the chick while the other forages. The guard phase lasts for 30-40 days. By then the chick has grown much bigger,\n                  can keep itself warm and protect itself against most predators. It becomes more curious and starts to explore its surroundings.\n                  It ends up forming a group with other chicks, a so-called crèche. Crèches are guarded by only a few adult birds; most parents\n                  can leave their chick to forage for themselves and their chick. Other species of penguins also practice this method of communal\n                  care for offspring. \n               \n               \n               By April the chicks are almost fully grown, but lose weight by fasting over the winter months, gaining it again during spring\n                  in September. Fledging then takes place in late spring/early summer. \n               \n               \n               King penguins form huge breeding colonies; for example, the colony on South Georgia Island at Salisbury Plain holds over 100,000\n                  breeding pairs and the one at St. Andrew's Bay over 100,000 birds. Because of the long breeding cycle, colonies are continuously\n                  occupied. \n               \n               \n               \n                  \t\t\t\t\n                  \t\t\t\n               \n               \n               The king penguin feeds its chicks by eating a fish, digesting it slightly and regurgitating the food into the chick's mouth.\n                  \n               \n               \n               \n                  \t\t\t\t\n                  \t\t\t\n               \n               \n               Because of their large size, king penguin chicks take 14-16 months before they are ready to go to sea. This is markedly different\n                  from smaller penguins, who rear their chicks through a single summer when food is plentiful. King penguins time their mating\n                  so the chicks will develop over the harshest season for fishing. In this way, by the time the young penguins are finally mature\n                  enough to leave their parents, it is summer when food is plentiful and conditions are more favorable for the young to survive\n                  alone. \n               \n               \n            \n            \n            \t\t\n         \n         \n         \t\n      \n      \n      \n   ",

Their vestigial wings have become flippers, useless for flight in the air.\n               In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Penguins' swimming looks very similar to bird's flight in the air.\n               Within the smooth plumage a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold\n               waters. On land, penguins use their tails and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance. \n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n             \n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n            All penguins are countershaded for camouflage – that is, they have black backs and wings with white fronts. A predator looking\n               up from below (such as an orca or a leopard seal) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective\n               water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above. \n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n            Diving penguins reach 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph), though there are reports of velocities of 27 km/h (17 mph) (which are\n               more realistic in the case of startled flight). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the\n               surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Dives of the large\n               Emperor Penguin have been recorded reaching a depth of 565 m (1,870 ft) for up to 22 minutes. \n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n            Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow, a movement called \"tobogganing\", which conserves\n               energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky\n               terrain. \n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n            Penguins have an average sense of hearing for birds;[33] this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded\n               colonies. Their eyes are adapted for underwater vision, and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators;\n               in air it has been suggested that they are nearsighted, although research has not supported this hypothesis.\n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n            Penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers that keeps them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater than\n               in air). The Emperor Penguin (the largest penguin) has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative\n               surface area and heat loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood that\n               gets cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females are at\n               sea fishing for food leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to keep warm and rotate\n               positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the center of the heat pack.\n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n            They can drink salt water because their supraorbital gland filters excess salt from the bloodstream. The salt is excreted\n               in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages.\n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n            The Great Auk of the Northern Hemisphere, now extinct, was superficially similar to penguins, and the word \"penguin\" was originally\n               used for that bird, centuries ago. They are not related to the penguins at all, but are an example of convergent evolution.\n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         \n            Isabelline penguins\n            \t\t\n            \t\t\n            Perhaps one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage. These are called isabelline\n               penguins, possibly in reference to the legend that the archduchess Isabella of Austria vowed not to change her undergarments\n               until her husband's siege of Ostend was successful—which took over three years to accomplish. Isabellinism is different from\n               albinism. Isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the\n               deep, and are often passed over as mates.\n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t\t\n            \n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n         \n         \n            \n            Parent topic: Penguins Overview\n            \n         \n         \n      \n   ",

The general Faroese term for skuas is kjógvi [ˈtʃɛkvə].

Many are partial kleptoparasites, comprising up to 95% of\n               the feeding methods of wintering birds, by chasing gulls, terns and other seabirds to steal their catches, regardless of the\n               size of the species attacked (up to 3 times heavier than the attacking skua). The larger species, such as the great skua,\n               also regularly kill and eat adult birds, such as puffins and gulls, and have been recorded as killing birds as large as a\n               grey heron. On the breeding grounds, the three, more slender Northern breeding species commonly eat lemmings. Those species\n               that breed in the Southern Oceans, largely feed on fish that can be caught near their colonies. The eggs and young of other\n               birds are an important food source for most skua species during the nesting season. In the Southern oceans and Antarctica\n               region, some skua species (especially the South Polar skua) will readily scavenge the carcasses at breeding colonies of penguins\n               and pinnipeds, sometimes taking live penguin chicks.

The most recent common ancestor of penguins and their sister\n            clade can be roughly dated to the Campanian–Maastrichtian boundary, around 70–68 million years ago. What can be said as certainly\n            as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that by the end of the Cretaceous, the penguin lineage must\n            have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so morphologically; it is fairly likely that they were not yet entirely\n            flightless at that time, as flightless birds have generally low resilience to the breakdown of trophic webs that follows the\n            initial phase of mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities (see also Flightless Cormorant). \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n         \n         \n            \n            Basal fossils\n               \n            \n            \n            Palaeeudyptines\n               \n            \n            \n            Origin and systematics of modern penguins\n               \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n         \n            \n            Parent topic: Systematics and evolution\n            \n         \n         \n      \n   ",

They call\n               in a variety of ways, but the most frequently heard is a loud trumpeting which is emitted with its head thrown back. \n               \n            \n            \n            \n            The application of Gentoo to the penguin is unclear. The Oxford English Dictionary notes that Gentoo used to be an Anglo-Indian\n               term used as early as 1638 to distinguish Hindus in India from Muslims. The English term originated from the Portuguese gentio\n               (compare \"gentile\"); in the 20th century the term came to be regarded as derogatory. \n               \n            \n            \n            \n             \n               \n            \n            \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n         \n         \n            \n            Parent topic: Pygoscelis (Brush-tailed penguins)\n            \n         \n         \n      \n       \n         \n          Taxonomy\n         \n         \n          \n            \t \n            The Gentoo penguin is one of three species in the genus \n               \t\tPygoscelis. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA evidence suggests the genus split from other penguins around 38 million years ago, about 2\n               million years after the ancestors of the genus Aptenodytes. In turn, the Adelie Penguins split off from the other members\n               of the genus around 19 million years ago, and the Chinstrap and Gentoo finally diverging around 14 million years ago. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            Two sub-species of this penguin are recognised: \n               \t\tPygoscelis papua papua and the smaller \n               \t\tPygoscelis papua ellsworthii' \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n       \n         \n         Description\n         \n         \n          \n             \n               \t \n               The Gentoo penguin is easily recognized by the wide white stripe extending like a bonnet across the top of its head and its\n                  bright orange-red bill. They have pale whitish-pink webbed feet and a fairly long tail - the most prominent tail of all penguins.\n                  Chicks have grey backs with white fronts. As the Gentoo penguin waddles along on land, its tail sticks out behind, sweeping\n                  from side to side, hence the scientific name Pygoscelis, which means \"rump-tailed\". \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n               Adult Gentoos reach a height of 51 to 90 cm (20-36 in), making them the third largest species of penguin after the two giant\n                  species, the \n                  \t\tEmperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) and the \n                  \t\tKing penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus). Males have a maximum weight of about 8.5 kg (19 lb) just before molting, and a minimum weight of about 4.9 kg (10.8 lb)\n                  just before mating. For females the maximum weight is 8.2 kg (18 lb) just before moulting, but their weight drops to as little\n                  as 4.5 kg (10 lb) when guarding the chicks in the nest. Birds from the north are on average 700 g (1.5 lb) heavier and 10\n                  cm (4 in) taller than the southern birds. Southern Gentoo penguins reach 75-80 cm (30-31 in) in length. They are the fastest\n                  underwater swimming penguins, reaching speeds of 36 km/h. Gentoo are adapted to very harsh cold climates. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n                \n                  \t \n               \n               \n             \n            \t \n            \n               Identification \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               Gentoo penguins are characterised by a white patch around and behind the eye that joins on the crown.

Two subspecies are recognised: a larger form in the sub-Antarctic and a smaller, but\n                  otherwise similar subspecies on the Antarctic Peninsula.

In Georgia,\n               for example, breeding colonies are two kilometers inland. Whereas in colonies farther inland, where the penguins nest between\n               tufts of grass, they shift location slightly every year because the grass may get trampled over time. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n             \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            Gentoos breed on many sub-Antarctic islands.

The\n               total breeding population is estimated to be over 300,000 pairs. Nests are usually made from a roughly circular pile of stones\n               and can be quite large, 20 cm high and 25 cm in diameter. The stones are jealously guarded and their ownership can be the\n               subject of noisy disputes between individual penguins. They are also prized by the females, even to the point that a male\n               penguin can obtain the favors of a female by offering her a nice stone. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n             \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            Two eggs are laid, both weighing around 500 g.

The excess salt is then expelled through the penguin's nose in a salty brine.\n                  Humboldt penguins are agile swimmers and they can reach speeds up to 32 km/hr (20 mph).

The\n            origin of the Spheniscinae lies probably in the latest Paleogene, and geographically it must have been much the same as the\n            general area in which the order evolved: the oceans between the Australia-New Zealand region and the Antarctic.[19] Presumedly\n            diverging from other penguins around 40 million years ago, it seems that the Spheniscinae were for quite some time limited\n            to their ancestral area, as the well-researched deposits of the Antarctic Peninsula and Patagonia have not yielded Paleogene\n            fossils of the subfamily. Also, the earliest spheniscine lineages are those with the most southern distribution.\n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         The genus Aptenodytes appears to be the basal most divergence among living penguins they have bright yellow-orange neck, breast,\n            and bill patches; incubate by placing their eggs on their feet, and when they hatch the chicks are almost naked. This genus\n            has a distribution centered on the Antarctic coasts and barely extends to some subantarctic islands today.\n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         Pygoscelis contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head pattern; their distribution is intermediate, centered\n            on Antarctic coasts but extending somewhat northwards from there. In external morphology, these apparently still resemble\n            the common ancestor of the Spheniscinae, as Aptenodytes' autapomorphies are in most cases fairly pronounced adaptations related\n            to that genus' extreme habitat conditions. As the former genus, Pygoscelis seems to have diverged during the Bartonian, but\n            the range expansion and radiation that led to the present-day diversity probably did not occur until much later; around the\n            Burdigalian stage of the Early Miocene, roughly 20–15 million years ago.\n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         The genera Spheniscus and Eudyptula contain species with a mostly subantarctic distribution centered on South America; some,\n            however, range quite far northwards. They all lack carotenoid coloration, and the former genus has a conspicuous banded head\n            pattern; they are unique among living penguins by nesting in burrows. This group probably radiated eastwards with the Antarctic\n            Circumpolar Current out of the ancestral range of modern penguins throughout the Chattian (Late Oligocene), starting approximately\n            28 million years ago. While the two genera separated during this time, the present-day diversity is the result of a Pliocene\n            radiation, taking place some 4–2 million years ago.\n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         The Megadyptes–Eudyptes clade occurs at similar latitudes (though not as far north as the Galapagos Penguin), has its highest\n            diversity in the New Zealand region, and represent a westward dispersal. They are characterized by hairy yellow ornamental\n            head feathers; their bills are at least partly red. These two genera diverged apparently in the Middle Miocene (Langhian,\n            roughly 15–14 million years ago), but again, the living species of Eudyptes are the product of a later radiation, stretching\n            from about the late Tortonian (Late Miocene, 8 million years ago) to the end of the Pliocene.\n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         The geographical and temporal pattern or spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of global cooling documented\n            in the paleoclimatic record. The emergence of the subantarctic lineage at the end of the Bartonian corresponds with the onset\n            of the slow period of cooling that eventually led to the ice ages some 35 million years later. With habitat on the Antarctic\n            coasts declining, by the Priabonian more hospitable conditions for most penguins existed in the subantarctic regions rather\n            than in Antarctica itself. Notably, the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current also started as a continuous circumpolar flow only\n            around 30 million years ago, on the one hand forcing the Antarctic cooling, and on the other facilitating the eastward expansion\n            of Spheniscus to South America and eventually beyond. Despite this, there is no fossil evidence to support the idea of a crown\n            radiation from the antarctic continent in the Paleogene.\n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         Later, an interspersed period of slight warming was ended by the Middle Miocene Climate Transition, a sharp drop in global\n            average temperature from 14–12 million years ago, and similar abrupt cooling events followed at 8 million years ago and 4\n            million years ago; by the end of the Tortonian, the Antarctic ice sheet was already much like today in volume and extent.\n            The emergence of most of today's subantarctic penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of Neogene climate\n            shifts.\n            \t \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n         \n         \n            \n            Parent topic: Evolution\n            \n         \n         \n      \n   ",

The female lays a single egg, which is incubated by the\n                     male while the female returns to the sea to feed; parents subsequently take turns foraging at sea and caring for their chick\n                     in the colony.

One of six species of crested penguin, it\n                     is very closely related to the Royal Penguin, and some authorities consider the two to be a single species. It bears a distinctive\n                     yellow crest, and the face and upperparts are black and sharply delineated from the white underparts. Adults weigh on average\n                     5.5 kg (12 lb) and are 70 cm (28 in) in length. The male and female are similar in appearance although the male is slightly\n                     larger with a relatively larger bill. Like all penguins, it is flightless, with a streamlined body and wings stiffened and\n                     flattened into flippers for a marine lifestyle. \n                     \t \n                  \n                  \n                  \t \n                  Its diet consists of a variety of crustaceans, mainly krill, as well as small fish and cephalopods; the species consumes more\n                     marine life annually than any other species of seabird. These birds moult once a year, spending about three to four weeks\n                     ashore, before returning to the sea. Numbering up to 100,000 individuals, the breeding colonies of the Macaroni Penguin are\n                     among the largest and densest of all penguin species. After spending the summer months breeding, penguins disperse into the\n                     oceans for six months; a 2009 study found that Macaroni Penguins from Kerguelen travelled over 10,000 km (6,200 mi) in the\n                     central Indian Ocean. With about 18 million individuals, the Macaroni Penguin is the most numerous penguin species. However,\n                     widespread declines in populations have been recorded since the mid-1970s. These factors resulted in their conservation status\n                     being reclassified as vulnerable. \n                     \t \n                  \n                  \n                  \t \n                   \n                     \t \n                  \n                  \n                  \n               \n               \n               \n            \n            \n            \n             \n               \n               Chatham Penguin, Eudyptes chathamensis (extinct) \n                  \n               \n               \n               \n                \n                  \t \n                  The Chatham Penguin (Eudyptes chathamensis) was a species of penguin, now extinct.

Its specific name is in honour of the German naturalist\n               Johann Reinhold Forster, who accompanied Captain James Cook on his second Pacific Voyage and officially named five other penguin\n               species. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            Together with the similarly coloured but smaller \n               \t\tKing Penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus), the emperor penguin is one of two extant species in the genus Aptenodytes . Fossil evidence of a third species-Ridgen's\n               Penguin (A. ridgeni)-has been found in fossil records from the late Pliocene, about three million years ago, in New Zealand.\n               Studies of penguin behaviour and genetics have proposed that the genus Aptenodytes is basal; in other words, that it split\n               off from a branch which led to all other living penguin species. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA evidence suggests this split\n               occurred around 40 million years ago. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n       \n         \n         Description\n         \n         \n         \n             \n               \t \n               The adult emperor penguin stands up to 110-130 cm (43-51 in) tall. The weight ranges from 22.7 to 45.4 kg (50 to 100 lb) and\n                  varies by sex, with males weighing more than females. It is the fifth heaviest living bird species, after only the larger\n                  varieties of ratite. The weight also varies by season, as both male and female penguins lose substantial mass while raising\n                  hatchlings and incubating eggs. A male emperor penguin must withstand the Antarctic cold for more than two months to protect\n                  his eggs from extreme cold. During this entire time he doesn't eat a thing. Most male penguins will lose about 12 kg (26 lb)\n                  while they wait for their babies to hatch. The mean weight of males at the start of the breeding season is 38 kg (84 lb) and\n                  that of females is 29.5 kg (65 lb). After the breeding season this drops to 23 kg (51 lb) for both sexes. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n               \n                   \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n               Like all penguin species, the Emperor has a streamlined body to minimize drag while swimming, and wings that have become stiff,\n                  flat flippers. The tongue is equipped with rear-facing barbs to prevent prey from escaping when caught. Males and females\n                  are similar in size and colouration. The adult has deep black dorsal feathers, covering the head, chin, throat, back, dorsal\n                  part of the flippers, and tail. The black plumage is sharply delineated from the light-coloured plumage elsewhere. The underparts\n                  of the wings and belly are white, becoming pale yellow in the upper breast, while the ear patches are bright yellow. The upper\n                  mandible of the 8 cm (3 in) long bill is black, and the lower mandible can be pink, orange or lilac. In juveniles, the auricular\n                  patches, chin and throat are white, while its bill is black. The emperor penguin chick is typically covered with silver-grey\n                  down and has a black head and white mask. A chick with all-white plumage was found in 2001, but was not considered to be an\n                  albino as it did not have pink eyes. Chicks weigh around 315 g (11 oz) after hatching, and fledge when they reach about 50%\n                  of adult weight. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n               The emperor penguin's dark plumage fades to brown from November until February, before the yearly moult in January and February.\n                  Moulting is rapid in this species compared with other birds, taking only around 34 days. emperor penguin feathers emerge from\n                  the skin after they have grown to a third of their total length, and before old feathers are lost, to help reduce heat loss.\n                  New feathers then push out the old ones before finishing their growth. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n               The average yearly survival rate of the emperor penguin has been measured at 95.1%, with an average life expectancy of 19.9\n                  years. The same researchers estimated that 1% of emperor penguins hatched could feasibly reach an age of 50 years. In contrast,\n                  only 19% of chicks survive their first year of life. \n                     \t\tTherefore, 80% of the emperor penguin population comprises adults five years and older. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n             \n            \t \n            \n               Vocalization \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               As the species has no fixed nest sites that individuals can use to locate their own partner or chick, the emperor penguin\n                  must rely on vocal calls alone for identification. It uses a complex set of calls that are critical to individual recognition\n                  between parents, offspring, and mates, displaying the widest variation in individual calls of all penguins. Vocalizing emperor\n                  penguins use two frequency bands simultaneously.

Water temperature is a frigid −1.8 °C (28.8 °F), which is much lower than the emperor\n                  penguin's average body temperature of 39 °C (102 °F). The species has adapted in several ways to counteract heat loss. Feathers\n                  provide 80-90% of its insulation, and it has a layer of sub-dermal fat which may be up to 3 cm (1.2 in) thick before breeding.\n                  This resultant blubber layer impedes the mobility of the Emperor on land compared to its less well fat-insulated cousin, the\n                  Magellanic Penguin. Its stiff feathers are short, lanceolate (spear-shaped), and densely packed over the entire skin surface.\n                  With around 100 feathers covering one square inch (15 feathers per cm2), it has the highest feather density of any bird species. An extra layer of insulation is formed by separate shafts of downy\n                  filaments between feathers and skin. Muscles allow the feathers to be held erect on land, reducing heat loss by trapping a\n                  layer of air next to the skin. Conversely, the plumage is flattened in water, thus waterproofing the skin and the downy underlayer.\n                  Preening is vital in facilitating insulation and in keeping the plumage oily and water-repellent. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               The emperor penguin is able to thermoregulate (maintain its core body temperature) without altering its metabolism, over a\n                  wide range of temperatures. Known as the thermoneutral range, this extends from -10 to 20 °C (14 to 68 °F). Below this temperature\n                  range, its metabolic rate increases significantly, although an individual can maintain its core temperature from 38.0 °C (100.4\n                  °F) down to −47 °C (−53 °F). Movement by swimming, walking, and shivering are three mechanisms for increasing metabolism;\n                  a fourth process involves an increase in the breakdown of fats by enzymes, which is induced by the hormone glucagon. At temperatures\n                  above 20 °C (68 °F), an emperor penguin may become agitated as its body temperature and metabolic rate rise to increase heat\n                  loss. Raising its wings and exposing the undersides increases the exposure of its body surface to the air by 16%, facilitating\n                  further heat loss. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            \n               Adaptations to pressure and low oxygen \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               In addition to the cold, the emperor penguin encounters another stressful condition on deep dives-markedly increased pressure\n                  of up to 40 times that of the surface, which in most other terrestrial organisms would cause barotrauma. The bones of the\n                  penguin are solid rather than air-filled, which eliminates the risk of mechanical barotrauma. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               While diving, the emperor penguin's oxygen use is markedly reduced, as its heart rate is reduced to as low as 15-20 beats\n                  per minute and non-essential organs are shut down, thus facilitating longer dives. Its hemoglobin and myoglobin are able to\n                  bind and transport oxygen at low blood concentrations; this allows the bird to function with very low oxygen levels that would\n                  otherwise result in loss of consciousness. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n       \n         \n         Distribution and habitat\n         \n         \n          \n             \n               \t \n               The emperor penguin has a circumpolar distribution in the Antarctic almost exclusively between the 66° and 77° south latitudes.\n                  It almost always breeds on stable pack ice near the coast and up to 18 km (11 mi) offshore. Breeding colonies are usually\n                  located in areas where ice cliffs and icebergs shelter them from the wind. The total population is estimated at around 400,000-450,000\n                  individuals, which are distributed among as many as 40 independent colonies. Around 80,000 pairs breed in the Ross Sea sector.\n                  Major breeding colonies are located at Cape Washington (20,000-25,000 pairs), Coulman Island in Victoria Land (around 22,000\n                  pairs), Halley Bay, Coats Land (14,300-31,400 pairs), and Atka Bay in Queen Maud Land (16,000 pairs). Two land colonies have\n                  been reported: one on a shingle spit at Dion Island on the Antarctic Peninsula, and one on a headland at Taylor Glacier in\n                  the Australian Antarctic Territory. Vagrants have been recorded on Heard Island, South Georgia, and in New Zealand. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n               \n                   \n                  \t \n               \n               \n             \n            \t \n            \n               Conservation status \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               \n                   \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               In 2012 the emperor penguin was uplisted from a species of least concern to near threatened by the IUCN. Along with nine other\n                  species of penguin, it is currently under consideration for inclusion under the US Endangered Species Act. The primary reasons\n                  for this are declining food availability due to the effects of climate change and industrial fisheries on the crustacean and\n                  fish populations. Other reasons for their potential placement on this list include disease, habitat destruction, and disturbance\n                  at breeding colonies by humans. Of particular concern is the impact of tourism. One study has shown emperor penguin chicks\n                  in a crèche become more apprehensive following helicopter approach to 1,000 m (3,281 ft). \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               Population declines of 50% in the Terre Adélie region have been observed due to increased adult mortality, especially of males,\n                  during an abnormally prolonged warm period in the late 1970s, which resulted in reduced sea-ice coverage. On the other hand,\n                  egg hatching success rates declined when the sea-ice extent increased. The species is therefore considered to be highly sensitive\n                  to climatic changes. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               A Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution study in January 2009 found emperor penguins could be pushed to the brink of extinction\n                  by the year 2100 due to global climate change. By applying mathematical models to predict how the loss of sea ice from climate\n                  warming would affect a big colony of emperor penguins at Terre Adélie, Antarctica, they forecast a decline of 87% in the colony's\n                  population by the end of the century, from the current 3,000 breeding pairs in the colony to 400 breeding pairs. The decline\n                  may be mirrored in the total emperor penguin population, estimated at about 238,000 breeding pairs in 46 colonies, using a\n                  satellite based census. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n       \n         \n         Behaviour\n         \n         \n          \n             \n               \t \n               The emperor penguin is a social animal in its nesting and its foraging behaviour; birds hunting together may coordinate their\n                  diving and surfacing. Individuals may be active day or night. A mature adult travels throughout most of the year between the\n                  nesting area and ocean foraging areas; the species disperses into the oceans from January to March. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n               The American physiologist Gerry Kooyman revolutionized the study of penguin foraging behaviour in 1971 when he published his\n                  results from attaching automatic dive-recording devices to emperor penguins. He found that the species reaches depths of 265\n                  m (869 ft), with dive periods of up to 18 minutes. Later research revealed a small female had dived to a depth of 535 m (1,755\n                  ft) near McMurdo Sound. It is possible that the emperor penguin can dive even deeper, as the accuracy of the recording devices\n                  is diminished at greater depths. Further study of one bird's diving behaviour revealed regular dives to 150 m (490 ft) in\n                  water around 900 m (3,000 ft) deep, and shallow dives of less than 50 m (160 ft), interspersed with deep dives of more than\n                  400 m (1,300 ft) in depths of 450 to 500 m (1,480 to 1,600 ft). This was suggestive of feeding near or at the sea bottom.\n                  \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n               Both male and female emperor penguins forage for food up to 500 km (311 mi) from colonies while collecting food to feed chicks,\n                  covering 82-1,454 km (51-903 mi) per individual per trip. A male returning to the sea after incubation heads directly out\n                  to areas of permanent open water, known as polynyas, around 100 km (62 mi) from the colony. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n               An efficient swimmer, the emperor penguin exerts pressure with both its upward and downward strokes while swimming. The upward\n                  stroke works against buoyancy and helps maintain depth. Its average swimming speed is 6-9 km/h (4-6 mph). On land, the emperor\n                  penguin alternates between walking with a wobbling gait and tobogganing-sliding over the ice on its belly, propelled by its\n                  feet and wing-like flippers. Like all penguins, it is flightless. The emperor penguin is a very powerful bird. In one case,\n                  a crew of six men, trying to capture a single male penguin for a zoo collection, were repeatedly tossed around and knocked\n                  over before all of the men had to collectively tackle the bird, which weighs about half as much as human male. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n               As a defence against the cold, a colony of emperor penguins forms a compact huddle (also known as the turtle formation) ranging\n                  in size from ten to several hundred birds, with each bird leaning forward on a neighbour. As the Wind chill is the least severe\n                  in the center of the colony, all the juveniles are usually huddled there. Those on the outside upwind tend to shuffle slowly\n                  around the edge of the formation and add themselves to its leeward edge, producing a slow churning action, and giving each\n                  bird a turn on the inside and on the outside. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n             \n            \t \n            \n               Diet \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               The emperor penguin's diet consists mainly of fish, crustaceans and cephalopods, although its composition varies from population\n                  to population. Fish are usually the most important food source, and the Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum) makes\n                  up the bulk of the bird's diet. Other prey commonly recorded include other fish of the family Nototheniidae, the Glacial Squid\n                  (Psychroteuthis glacialis), and the hooked squid species Kondakovia longimana, as well as Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba).\n                  The emperor penguin searches for prey in the open water of the Southern Ocean, in either ice-free areas of open water or tidal\n                  cracks in pack ice. One of its feeding strategies is to dive to around 50 m (164 ft), where it can easily spot sympagic fish\n                  like the Bald notothen (Pagothenia borchgrevinki) swimming against the bottom surface of the sea-ice; it swims up to the bottom\n                  of the ice and catches the fish. It then dives again and repeats the sequence about half a dozen times before surfacing to\n                  breathe. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            \n               Predators \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               The emperor penguin's predators include birds and aquatic mammals. The \n                  \t\t  Southern giant Petrel (Macronectes giganteus) is the predominant land predator of chicks, responsible for up to 34% of chick deaths in some colonies though they often\n                  scavenge dead penguins as well. The South Polar Skua(Stercorarius maccormicki) mainly scavenges for dead chicks, as the live\n                  chicks are too large to be attacked by the time of its annual arrival in the colony. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               The known aquatic predators are both mammals: the Leopard Seal (Hydrurga leptonyx), which takes some adult birds, as well\n                  as fledglings soon after they enter the water, and the Orca (Orcinus orca), which takes adult birds. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               If one of a breeding pair dies or is killed during the breeding season, the surviving parent must abandon its egg or young\n                  and go back to the sea to feed. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            \n               Courtship and breeding \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               The emperor penguin is able to breed at around three years of age, and usually commences breeding around one to three years\n                  later. The yearly reproductive cycle begins at the start of the Antarctic winter, in March and April, when all mature emperor\n                  penguins travel to colonial nesting areas, often walking 50 to 120 km (31 to 75 mi) inland from the edge of the pack ice.\n                  The start of travel appears to be triggered by decreasing day lengths; emperor penguins in captivity have been induced successfully\n                  into breeding by using lighting systems mimicking seasonal Antarctic day lengths. The penguins start courtship in March or\n                  April, when the temperature can be as low as −40 °C (−40 °F). A lone male gives an ecstatic display, where it stands still\n                  and places its head on its chest before inhaling and giving a courtship call for 1-2 seconds; it then moves around the colony\n                  and repeats the call. A male and female then stand face to face, with one extending its head and neck up and the other mirroring\n                  it; they both hold this posture for several minutes. Once in pairs, couples waddle around the colony together, with the female\n                  usually following the male. Before copulation, one bird bows deeply to its mate, its bill pointed close to the ground, and\n                  its mate then does the same. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               \n                   \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               Emperor penguins are serially monogamous. They have only one mate each year, and stay faithful to that mate. However, fidelity\n                  between years is only about 15%. The narrow window of opportunity available for mating appears to be an influence, as there\n                  is a priority to mate and breed which often precludes waiting for the appearance of the previous year's partner. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               The female penguin lays one 460-470 g (1 lb) egg in May or early June; it is vaguely pear-shaped, pale greenish-white, and\n                  measures around 12 × 8 cm (4¾ x 3 in). It represents just 2.3% of its mother's body weight, making it one of the smallest\n                  eggs relative to the maternal weight in any bird species. 15.7% of the weight of an emperor penguin egg is shell; like those\n                  of other penguin species, the shell is relatively thick, which minimises risk of breakage. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               \n                   \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               After laying, the mother's nutritional reserves are exhausted and she very carefully transfers the egg to the male, before\n                  immediately returning to the sea for two months to feed. The transfer of the egg can be awkward and difficult, and many couples\n                  drop the egg in the process. When this happens, the chick inside is quickly lost, as the egg cannot withstand the freezing\n                  temperatures on the icy ground. The male spends the winter incubating the egg in his brood pouch, balancing it on the tops\n                  of his feet, for 64 consecutive days until hatching. The emperor penguin is the only species where this behaviour is observed;\n                  in all other penguin species both parents take shifts incubating. By the time the egg hatches, the male will have fasted for\n                  around 115 days since arriving at the colony. To survive the cold and winds of up to 200 km/h (120 mph), the males huddle\n                  together, taking turns in the middle of the huddle. They have also been observed with their backs to the wind to conserve\n                  body heat. In the four months of travel, courtship, and incubation, the male may lose as much as 20 kg (44 lb), from around\n                  38 kg to just 18 kg (84 lb to 40 lb). \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               Hatching may take as long as two or three days to complete, as the shell of the egg is thick. Newly hatched chicks are semi-altricial,\n                  covered with only a thin layer of down and entirely dependent on their parents for food and warmth. If the chick hatches before\n                  the mother's return, the father feeds it a curd-like substance composed of 59% protein and 28% lipid, which is produced by\n                  a gland in his esophagus. The young chick is brooded in what is called the guard phase, spending time balanced on its parent's\n                  feet and sheltered in the brood pouch. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               \n                   \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               The female penguin returns at any time from hatching to ten days afterwards, from mid-July to early August. She finds her\n                  mate among the hundreds of fathers by his vocal call and takes over caring for the chick, feeding it by regurgitating the\n                  food that she has stored in her stomach. The male then leaves to take his turn at sea, spending around 24 days there before\n                  returning. The parents then take turns, one brooding while the other forages at sea. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               About 45-50 days after hatching, the chicks form a crèche, huddling together for warmth and protection. During this time,\n                  both parents forage at sea and return periodically to feed their chicks. A crèche may comprise up to several thousand birds\n                  densely packed together and is essential for surviving the low Antarctic temperatures. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               From early November, chicks begin moulting into juvenile plumage, which takes up to two months and is often not completed\n                  by the time they leave the colony; adults cease feeding them during this time. All birds make the considerably shorter trek\n                  to the sea in December or January and spend the rest of the summer feeding there \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n   ",

In New Zealand, they are also called \n               Little Blue Penguins, or just \n               Blue Penguins, owing to their slate-blue plumage, and they are called \n               Kororā in Māori. \n               \n            \n            \n            \n             \n               \n            \n            \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n         \n         \n            \n            Parent topic: Eudyptula (Little penguins)\n            \n         \n         \n      \n       \n         \n         Taxonomy\n         \n         \n          \n            \t \n            The Little Penguin was first described by German naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster in 1781. There are several subspecies\n               but a precise classification of these is still a matter of dispute. The holotypes of the subspecies Eudyptula minor variabilis\n               and Eudyptula minor chathamensis are in the collection of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. The White-flippered\n               Penguin is sometimes considered a subspecies, sometimes a distinct species, and sometimes a morph. As the Australian and Otago\n               (eastern South Island) Little Penguins seem to be a distinct species to which the specific name minor would apply, the White-flippered\n               birds indeed belong to a distinct species, although not exactly as originally assumed. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n             Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA evidence suggests the split between Eudyptula and Spheniscus occurred around 25 million years\n               ago, with the ancestors of the White-flippered and Little Penguins diverging about 2.7 million years ago. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n       \n         \n          Description\n         \n         \n          \n            \t \n            Like those of all penguins, the little penguin's wings have developed into flippers used for swimming. The Little Penguin\n               typically grows to between 30 and 33 cm (12 to 13 inches) tall and usually weighs about 1.5 kilogram on average (3.3 pounds).\n               The head and upperparts are blue in colour, with slate-grey ear coverts fading to white underneath, from the chin to the belly.\n               The flippers are blue. The dark grey-black beak is 3-4 cm long, the irises pale silvery- or bluish-grey or hazel, and the\n               feet pink above with black soles and webbing. An immature individual will have a shorter bill and lighter upperparts. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            Like most seabirds, they have a long lifespan.

The\n               species is not considered endangered, except for the White-Flippered subspecies found only on Banks Peninsula and nearby Motunau\n               Island in New Zealand. Since the 1960s, the mainland population has declined by 60-70%; though there has been a small increase\n               on Motunau Island. But overall Little Penguin populations have been decreasing as well, with some colonies having been wiped\n               out and other populations continuing to be at risk. However, new colonies have been established in urban areas. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            The greatest threat to Little Penguin populations has been predation (including nest predation) from cats, foxes, large reptiles,\n               ferrets and stoats. Due to their diminutive size and the introduction of new predators, some colonies have been reduced in\n               size by as much as 98% in just a few years, such as the small colony on Middle Island, near Warrnambool, Victoria, which was\n               reduced from 5000 penguins to 100. Because of this threat of colony collapse, conservationists pioneered an experimental technique\n               using Maremma Sheepdogs to protect the colony and fend off would-be predators. \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n             \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n       \n         \n          Behaviour\n         \n         \n         \n             \n               \t \n               In contrast to the other species, Little Penguins are nocturnal. That means they generally do not enter the shore before dusk\n                  and leave it before dawn. They forage during the day and often will sleep beside the nest at night after they have fed chicks.\n                  This species nests in burrows, under trees, in rock crevices, and sometimes in caves. Usually nests are clustered to form\n                  colonies, but single breeding pairs are not uncommon. At sea Little Penguins are often found alone or in small groups of up\n                  to ten birds, but sometimes these groups can be much larger. Although foraging trip durations can be highly variable, Little\n                  Penguins tend to stay close to the coast. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n             \n            \t \n            \n                Diet \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               These birds feed by hunting fish, squid and other small sea animals, for which they travel and dive quite extensively. They\n                  are generally inshore feeders. The use of data loggers has provided information of the diving behavior of Little Penguins.\n                  50% of their dives go no deeper than 2 m and the mean diving time is 21 seconds. Yet, they are able to dive as deep as 20m\n                  and remained submerged as long as 60 sec. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            \n               Breeding \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               Little penguins dig out (0,5 m) deep burrows for their nest.

The period of egg laying is long\n                  and flexible, between June and October with a peak in September. In good years even two clutches can be raised in one year.\n                  Normally two (sometimes even 3) eggs are laid and mostly both chicks will hatch and fledge. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               Incubation lasts 33 till 39 days, in alternating shifts of 1 à 3 days by both parents. When they hatch, chicks have a brown-grey\n                  down, which is replaced by a chocolate brown down on the back and a light grey down on the front after one week. Chicks are\n                  guarded during 30 days by one parent, while the other one feeds them. Crèches are sometimes made, but only in very small groups\n                  of up to 6 chicks. The chicks moult and fledge in March when they are 50 till 65 days (8 weeks) old. Chicks are fed at night\n                  (nocturnal! ). Little penguins are loyal for live and return every year to the same nest and partner. Although sedentary birds,\n                  some breeding pairs will stay in the neighbouring water from April till August or court ashore.

They stay by the Cromwell Current during the day since it is cooler and return to the\n                  land at night. They eat small schooling fish, mainly mullet, sardines, and sometimes crustaceans. They only go search for\n                  food during the day and normally within a few kilometers of their breeding site. They depend on the cold nutrient-rich currents\n                  to bring them food. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n               The temperature at the islands stays between 15 and 28 degrees Celsius (59-82 °F). During El Niño seasons, the penguins put\n                  off breeding since their food becomes less abundant; this makes the chances of raising offspring successfully unfavorable\n                  compared to the chances of dying in the attempt. They usually breed when the sea surface temperature is below 24 degrees Celsius\n                  (75 °F) which results in more food for them. The strong sun is the main problem for the penguins. Their primary means of cooling\n                  off is going into the water, but they have other behavioral adaptations because of all the time they spend on land. They use\n                  two methods of thermoregulation in warmer weather on land. One is by stretching out their flippers and hunching forward to\n                  keep the sun from shining on their feet, since they can lose heat from their flippers due to the blood flow there. They also\n                  pant, using evaporation to cool the throat and airways. Galapagos penguins protect their eggs and chicks from the hot sun\n                  by keeping them in deep crevices in the rocks. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n               \t \n               The species is endangered, with an estimated population size of around 1,500 individuals in 2004, according to a survey by\n                  the Charles Darwin Research Station. The population underwent an alarming decline of over 70% in the 1980s, but is slowly\n                  recovering. It is therefore the rarest penguin species (a status which is often falsely attributed to the Yellow-eyed Penguin).\n                  Population levels are influenced by the effects of the El Niño Southern Oscillation, which reduces the availability of shoaling\n                  fish, leading to low reproduction or starvation. However, anthropogenic factors (e.g. oil pollution, fishing by-catch and\n                  competition) may be adding to the ongoing demise of this species. On Isabela Island, introduced cats, dogs and rats attack\n                  penguins and destroy their nests. When in the water, they are preyed upon by sharks, fur seals, and sea lions. \n                  \t \n               \n               \n             \n            \t \n            \n               Breeding \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               There are less than 1000 breeding pairs of Galapagos penguins in the world. Breeding begins when the temperature of the sea\n                  surface falls to around 24°C. Most nests are seen between May and January. The nests are made within 50 metres (160 ft) of\n                  the water on the shore, usually on Fernandina and Isabela Islands. Adults stay near the breeding area during the year with\n                  their mate that they have chosen for life. When the penguins are breeding, incubation takes 38-40 days with both parents helping\n                  out. After thirty days of the chicks being born and both parents sharing responsibility of taking care of them, the chicks\n                  have feathers that are brown above and white below. The purpose of this is to protect the chicks from the strong sun more\n                  so than keeping them warm. The Galapagos penguin mates for life. It lays one or two eggs in places such as caves and crevices,\n                  protected from direct sunlight, which can lead to the eggs overheating. One parent will always stay with the eggs or chicks\n                  while the other is absent for several days to feed. The parents usually only rear up one child. If there is not enough food\n                  available, the nest may be abandoned. Bermudian naturalist Louis L. Mowbray was the first who successfully bred the Galapagos\n                  penguin in captivity \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            \n               Predators \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               Because of the Galapagos penguin's smaller size, it has many predators. On land, the penguins must keep an eye out for crabs,\n                  snakes, owls, and hawks, while in the water they must avoid sharks, fur seals, and sea lions. They face many hazards due to\n                  humans, as well as the hazards of unreliable food resources and volcanic activity. Illegal fishermen interrupt the penguins'\n                  nesting trees, and they are often caught in fishing nets by mistake. Much balance has to take place to ensure that the Galápagos\n                  Penguins do not become extinct. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n   ",

Thick blubber deposits provide insulation, as well, and blood vessels in the flippers and legs have evolved\n                  intricate structures to preserve heat. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               They live on barren islands and during winter congregate on large icebergs of the sub-Antarctic Region and the Antarctic Peninsula;\n                  however, they require solid, snow-free ground for nesting. The chinstrap penguin's primary predator is the leopard seal. The\n                  12-13 million chinstrap penguins have typical lifespan of 15-20 years. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n               Chinstrap penguins are considered the most aggressive species of penguin \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \t \n            \n               Diet \n               \t\t \n               \t\t\n               Their diet consists of krill, shrimp, and fish, for which they swim up to 80 km (50 mi) offshore each day.

They prefer slopes,\n                  cliffs and ridges on ice free places. Sometimes they breed together with other Pygoscelis species, but on another level than\n                  the rest. They arrive in the colony to court end September-November. Once pairs are made, the female lays 2 eggs in November-December\n                  which will be incubated by both parents in \"shifts\" of 5 à 10 days. The eggs hatch after 33 till 35 days and the chicks remain\n                  in the nest for another 20 à 30 days, before they gather in crèches. There they stay for some weeks, being fed daily. The\n                  chicks moult to their juvenile plumage and leave the nest in end February-March after 50 à 60 days. After the breeding period\n                  the adult birds leave too to forage at sea and return shortly after to moult in March-April. In the period between May till\n                  September the colony is abandoned and all the birds migrate to sea. \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t\t\n                \n                  \t\t\n               \n               \n               \t \n            \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n   ",

The \n            \t\tNew Zealand Giant Penguin was probably the heaviest, weighing 80 kg or more. Both were found on New Zealand, the former also in the Antarctic farther\n            eastwards. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         Traditionally, most extinct species of penguins, giant or small, had been placed in the paraphyletic subfamily called Palaeeudyptinae.\n            More recently, with new taxa being discovered and placed in the phylogeny if possible, it is becoming accepted that there\n            were at least two major extinct lineages. One or two closely related ones occurred in Patagonia, and at least one other—which\n            is or includes the paleeudyptines as recognized today – occurred on most Antarctic and subantarctic coasts. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         But size plasticity seems to have been great at this initial stage of penguin radiation: on Seymour Island, Antarctica, for\n            example, around 10 known species of penguins ranging in size from medium to huge apparently coexisted some 35 million years\n            ago during the Priabonian (Late Eocene).[24] It is not even known whether the gigantic palaeeudyptines constitute a monophyletic\n            lineage, or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a much restricted Palaeeudyptinae and the Anthropornithinae – whether\n            they were considered valid, or whether there was a wide size range present in the Palaeeudyptinae as delimited as usually\n            done these days (i.e., including Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi). The oldest well-described giant penguin, the 5-foot (1.5 m)-tall\n            Icadyptes salasi, actually occurred as far north as northern Peru about 36 million years ago. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         In any case, the gigantic penguins had disappeared by the end of the Paleogene, around 25 million years ago. Their decline\n            and disappearance coincided with the spread of the Squalodontoidea and other primitive, fish-eating toothed whales, which\n            certainly competed with them for food, and were ultimately more successful. A new lineage, the Paraptenodytes, which includes\n            smaller but decidedly stout-legged forms, had already arisen in southernmost South America by that time. The early Neogene\n            saw the emergence of yet another morphotype in the same area, the similarly sized but more gracile Palaeospheniscinae, as\n            well as the radiation that gave rise to the penguin biodiversity of our time. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n         \n         \n            \n            Parent topic: Evolution\n            \n         \n         \n      \n   ",

They exhibit very little sexual dimorphism in size. The\n            necks are able to kink in an S-shape, due to the modified shape of the sixth vertebrae. The neck is able to retract and extend,\n            and is retracted during flight, unlike most other long-necked birds. The legs are long and strong and in almost every species\n            are unfeathered from the lower part of the tibia. In flight the legs and feet are held backward.

It can vary from extremely fine, as in the agami heron, to thick as in the grey\n            heron. The most atypical bill is owned by the boat-billed heron, which has a broad thick bill. The bill, as well as other\n            bare parts of the body, is usually yellow, black or brown coloured, although this colour can vary during the breeding season.\n            The wings are broad and long, exhibiting 10-11 primaries feathers (the boat-billed heron has only nine), 15-20 secondaries\n            and 12 rectrices (10 in the bitterns). The feathers of the herons are soft and the plumage is usually blue, black, brown,\n            grey or white, and can often be strikingly complex. Amongst the day herons there is little sexual dimorphism in plumage (except\n            in the pond-herons); differences between the sexes are the rule for the night herons and smaller bitterns. Many species also\n            have different colour morphs. In the Pacific reef heron there are both dark and light colour morphs, and the percentage of\n            each morph varies geographically.

Coots are found throughout the world in larger inland waters\n            and streams, where they swim and bob for food, mostly plants, seeds, mollusks, and worms. Coots have greenish or bluish gray\n            feet, the toes of which are fringed by a lobed membrane that facilitates swimming and walking over plant-choked marshes and\n            ooze. The beak is short and conical, surmounted by a flattened fleshy shield that extends onto the forehead. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         \n            \t\t\n            \n               \t\t\n            \n            \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         The European coot (F. atra) breeds abundantly in many northern parts of the Old World, in winter resorting to river mouths\n            or shallow bays of the sea. About 45 centimetres (18 inches) long and sometimes more than 900 grams (2 pounds) in weight,\n            the seemingly short-winged coot appears to rise with difficulty from the water, pattering along the surface with its feet.\n            It is capable of long-sustained and rapid flight. Although not considered to be game birds, coots sometimes are hunted in\n            winter, when they are most gregarious. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         Coots nest in masses of water plants, laying as many as ten speckled eggs. The young are beautifully clothed in jet-black\n            down, with heads of bright orange scarlet, varied with purplish blue. This brilliant colouring is soon lost; adults have sooty\n            black plumage and a bare white callus on the forehead. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         The coot of North America, or mud hen (F. americana), closely resembles the European bird. In South America about six species\n            are found, one (F. gigantea) being of considerable size; F. caribaea occurs also in the West Indies. An African species (F.\n            cristata) is distinguished by two red knobs on the forehead. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         The scoter, a diving duck of the family Anatidae, is also called a sea coot. \n            \t \n         \n         \n         \t \n         For more information: \n            \t\tEncyclopedia Britannica - Coot (bird) \n            \t \n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n         \n         \n            \n            Parent topic: Other birds\n            \n         \n         \n      \n   ",

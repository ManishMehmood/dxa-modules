The voice tag can be, for example, a\n            name.\n         \n         \n         \n         Before using voice dialling, note that:\n            \n               \n               Voice tags are not language dependent. They are dependent on the speakerâ€™s voice.\n               \n               \n               Voice tags are sensitive to background noise. Record them and make calls in a quiet environment.\n               \n               \n               Very short names are not accepted. Use long names and avoid similar names for different numbers.\n               \n               \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n         \n            \n               Press and hold the right selection key  in standby mode until you hear a short tone.\n               \n            \n            \n            \n               Say the voice tag clearly while holding the phone in the normal position near to your ear.\n               \n               The phone plays the voice tag and dials the related phone number.\n               \n            \n            \n         \n         \n         \n         If no match for the voice tag is found or recognised, the phone returns to standby mode.\n         \n         \n      \n      \n      \n      \n         \n         \n            \n            Parent topic: Making a call\n            \n         \n         \n         \n         Related tasks\n            \n            \n            Making a call\n            \n            Answering or rejecting a call\n         \n         \n         \n         Related information\n            \n            \n            Speed Dialling\n            \n            Call functions\n            \n            Keys overview\n         \n         \n      \n   ",
